## Meeting notes
- Getting used to hugging face https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1
- Check the data 
	- Does it seem well labelled?
	- Get used to it
- Can we collect the documents from their ID
- Restaurant places
	- Friedrichstein (easter part of town)
	- Berghain (best before, not anymore)
	- Prenzlauer Berg

### Next steps
- Text explanation of why it as been classified as this or that?
- Multi-lingual classification?

### Brainstormig
https://sdgs.un.org/goals#goals
- TARS paper
- Text classification of the task to text-to-text (MT5 model from google)
- Have a binary classifier per class?
- Create embeddings and check their similarity with SDGs embeddings
- Prompt based classification (GPT-3, generates a follow up of the prompt)
- Data augmentation:
	- **collect other documents**? -> Request from Leo
	- Modify the sentences (check nl_augmenter on github, quillbot)
		- Prompting
		- Add noise
		- Backtranslation
		- Substitute antonyms
		- Rephrasing, paraphrasing (quillbot.com)
- Explainable AI (a PhD student is currently writing a paper on that): 
	- heatmaps are great but, ... 
	- have a textual explanation
- Zero-shot classification + attention is all you need
- Find out which company has actually stated the sentences + find the documents to have more context (Hierarchical classification)
- Rotary embeddings (positional embeddings, attention embeddings)? https://paperswithcode.com/method/rope

### Multiple approaches
- Labelled (TARS approach)
- Distance measure
- Combination of them?

### Objective
Publish a hugging face model ?
