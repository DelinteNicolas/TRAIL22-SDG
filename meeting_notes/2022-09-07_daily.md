- We will use the meeting in the General channel for the dailies from now on
- Nicolas: hugging face interface
	- Added a demo on the hugging face
	- Take colours from ColorBrewer (https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3)
- Ahmed: 
	- Naive bayes
		- Neglect every word that occurs less than 4 times
		- Train accuracy >70%
		- Test accuracy <60%
		- Try without prior #TODO
	- Random forest
		- Test set > 72% accuracy
		- num_estimators = 100 seems a good amount
		- Removed class 17 for bias then class 16 was biased -> removed both and the bias seems to disappear
- Identify wrong labels from very high confident misclassifications ? #TODO 
- Martin: test with "None" values
	- Trying to identify semantics. For instance, "We are not interested in SDG 9" should classify the sentence as "not 9", but we do not know what "Not 9" is
- Add negative examples (sentences not related to SDGs) #TODO 
- Put everything (all the notebooks) together in a consistent code
- Bastien: binary classifier for each of the labels
	- Take the class from the most confident one
	- Same bias towards class 17
	- Advantage: there is a "no SDG" class
- Investigate corelations between classes #TODO
