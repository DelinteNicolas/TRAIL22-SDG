- Be careful with the model that we use: different models are meant to be used for different tasks
- Try zero-shot classification and see how it compares to a labelled approach
- Add data that is linked to any of the SDG (embed the data and only take the sentences that are sufficiently close)
- Training data is rather balanced (SDG 17 has almost 200 sentences and SDG-7 has just above 50)
- Word clouds for each SDG give rather good 
	- Try a TF/IDF approach ?
- Checklist installed for Martin
- Check scenarios like "I want to go to the restaurant" to check that it does not labels it as 2 (about hunger, etc). -> Try some kind of adversarial approach?

**We will use pytorch going forward when it is not a hugging face standard model.**

## TODO
- TF/IDF approach (ntlk)
- Finish the tutorial
- Setup some code that allows to compare the results from different methods
- Try keyword approcah (zero-shot-classification)


# Philippe's notes
- TF/IDF-baseline with Naive Bayes (maybe this URL is helpfull? https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html)
- Evaluate performance on test set (which metrics? accuracy, ?AUC?, class-wise performance, confusion matrix)
- How to deal with texts which are not SDG? (E.g., I like to go to the restaurant and have lunch)
- More test-cases
