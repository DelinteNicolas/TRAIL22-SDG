Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A imagery, total suspended solids and chlorophyll-a are mapped over time for a select number of large surface water bodies in Peru, Senegal, and Zambia. All of the EO datasets used are of global coverage and publicly available at no cost. The temporal consistency and long time-series of many of the datasets enable replicability over time, making reporting of change from baseline values consistent and systematic. We find that statistical comparisons between different surface water data products can help provide some degree of confidence for countries during their validation process and highlight the need for accuracy assessments when using EO-based land change data for SDG reporting. We also raise concern that EO data in the context of SDG Indicator 6.6.1 reporting may be more challenging for some countries, such as small island nations, than others to use in assessing the extent of water-related ecosystems due to scale limitations and climate variability. Country-driven validation of the EO data products remains a priority to ensure successful data integration in support of SDG Indicator 6.6.1 reporting. Multi-country studies such as this one can be valuable tools for helping to guide the evolution of SDG monitoring methodologies and provide a useful resource for countries reporting on water-related ecosystems. The EO data analyses and statistical methods used in this study can be easily replicated for country-driven validation of EO data products in the future.",6

This technology has been used to update the drainage of the Son-Karamnasa interfluves and demarcate the 13 watersheds. It is an ideal unit for land and water resource management. As the development of large areas is not feasible in one stretch, the region needs the prioritisation of the watershed for development processes according to their priority. Watershed prioritisation has been done by using the ranking method of the morphometric parameters in linear, areal and relief aspects in the study area. On the basis of run-off and erodibility of the watershed characteristics, the rank of each parameter has been assigned. This rank was further categorised into high, medium and low priority for land and water resource management.",12

An intensive literature search of Scopus and the web of science database was explored with different relevant sets of keywords “Institutional investors AND Education”, “Institutional investors” AND “Higher education”, which drew 29 final articles between 2010–2021. This scoping review draws a new open approach for creating alternative sustainable funding for the higher education system and investment opportunities for institutional investors with government intervention. This research becomes the first that shows the road map to the higher education system in creating alternative funding through the proposed Institutional Investor & Sustainable University Funding Governance Code, which will make the higher education system independent and ease the burden on the government, as well as create a huge market opportunity for both players.

A huge research scope lies in materials waste management of upstream textiles and apparel manufacturing within the scopes of circular economy to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 12 for Bangladesh. This research identifies and categorises the materials waste generated in various production stages, determines the economic loss, and traces the informal trading of waste materials. Following an exploratory multiple-case approach, this research collects data from 17 textiles and apparel factories through semi-structured questionnaires, followed by materials stream mapping and observations. The study estimates a loss of approximately 0.70 USD for every piece of apparel export. To trace the destination of waste, it has been found that approximately 15 tons of informal trading of wastes took place in a single underground market. Overall, it leads to a significant loss of value addition that could have been added through a circular economy. Finally, to help achieve SDG 12, this study develops a conceptual waste management model in upstream textiles and apparel manufacturing with potential application opportunities within the circular economy.",12

The goal that promotes sustainable and inclusive economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. This goal confirms the relationship that exists between decent work and well-being improvement. Specifically, the study focused on the assessment of private employers’ awareness on the SDG 8 and its implications for well-being improvement in Dodoma Capital City, Tanzania. The study adopted a cross-sectional research design. Purposive and random sampling techniques were employed to select the representative sample. Data collection methods comprised of surveys, key informants’ interviews, and documentary review with the private employers’ influenced by Autonomy and Decision Making Theory. A total of 100 individual private employers and employees were directly administered with questionnaires. Descriptive and inferential statistics, such as Chi-squire was used to test for significance of data and regression analysis employed to assess the impact of private employers’ awareness of SDG 8 on well-being improvement. Generally, the findings show that overall, 53.3% of the employers are not aware of the labour right due to lack of enough knowledge on the SDG 8. This is correlated with the employers’ unawareness of the SDG 8 which has influence on the protection of labour rights. The regression estimates on the impact of employers’ awareness of SDG 8 on well-being improvement indicates that the knowledge awareness and work experience among the employers were statistically significant. This demonstrate that the wellbeing improvement are mostly contributed by factors such as employers and employee’s knowledge and awareness of SDG 8 and work experience. The study concludes that despite many progresses in the private sector, not all the workforce is enjoying decent work. In terms of policy, the study recommends an integrated approach that addresses the goals of well-being improvement, which requires employees’ knowledge awareness and inclusiveness in order to achieve SDG 8. That is the policy priorities for achieving many of the other SDGs depends on progress under the SDG 8.Finally, mobilizing the policy priorities, supporting knowledge access and skill building for SDG 8-related interventions is therefore, crucial for well-being improvement. The success of the SDG 8 depends largely on the initiatives of the public and private sectors.",8

In earlier work, we designed and implemented a prototype cataloguefor geospatial educational resources, aimed at a target audience in higher education. The success of search and discovery in anycatalogue relies heavily on the metadata that describes catalogue entries. Initial feedback showed that users find it difficult to usesome of the metadata elements in the prototype to describe their teaching materials. In order to better understand their difficulties andfurther refine the metadata for describing educational resources that are used for geospatial purposes specifically, we asked a numberof participants to describe geospatial educational resources according to four sets of metadata attributes. This paper presents theresults of the study and recommends a set of metadata attributes that are specifically useful for geospatial educational resources.Implementation trade-offs are discussed, e.g., deciding between metadata attributes that are very specific or more generic, andcatalogue entries that are immediately available to Web search engines without any quality checks vs. catalogue entries that aremoderated by a community of educators before publishing them. By providing metadata about geospatial educational resources, theinternational geospatial community can contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 to ensure inclusive and equitablequality education and to promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.",4

The global economy has been long-calling for a paradigm shift as far as the consumption and production models have been concerned over the last decades. In this regard, transforming our world to the imperative vision described in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development can be made possible if global markets respond efficiently to the goals and targets set in the 2030 Agenda. Taking this into consideration, business models, production patterns, purchasing and consumption habits represent key elements that are connected to the indictors designed to monitor the progress and performance achieved with regard to the SDG 12: tracking resource management efficiency, the circularity of economic activities, production and consumption footprint and others. Given the importance of quantifying results with the aim of ensuring the timely achievement of the SDG KPIs, the objective of this research was to carry out a synoptic quantitative analysis on EU-27’s progress and performance with regard to the targets and indicators of SDG 12—not only from the perspective of the well-defined methodological framework described in Agenda, but also from the perspective of the scientific results published in the papers specific to the field of sustainable production and consumption patterns. Findings highlight the ongoing ardent transition to a more resource-efficient and circular European economic system. In the race for shifting the production and consumption patterns from the conventional model to the one that has the sustainability factor at its core in the EU-27, the vectors of change proved to be Finland, Austria and Latvia.",12
808,paper,Does the theoretical language of SDG 5 hinder understanding and addressing intimate partner violence cross-culturally? Some epistemological concerns and …,"Overcoming intimate partner violence as loci of female subordination contributing to women’s abuse. In recent years, this scholarship has enlarged to integrate more anthropological insights, has paid more attention to male perpetrators and has appraised religious parameters in more nuanced ways, but the fundamental premises that violence affecting women has gendered motivations and that a subversion of the status quo is necessary to alleviate the problem persist. This paper will draw attention to the epistemological implications of preconceiving IPV as gendered violence and will discuss the limitations of employing this analytical construct to understand and to address the problem in its cross-cultural manifestations. The paper will first trace current theorisations of gender to western metaphysics, and demonstrate how these have underpinned conceptualisations of IPV in the international development sector, limiting a more nuanced understanding of the problem through local conceptual repertoires. It will draw insights from a study of conjugal abuse in an Orthodox society of Ethiopia to evidence the practical implications for cross-cultural development. This study integrated a theology-informed analysis of relevant Church teachings with an ethnographic exploration of local metaphysics of subjectivity, gender relations and religious experience within marriage. Key insights challenge the theoretical language of SDG 5 and weaken understandings that more gender egalitarian relations can suffice to change local pernicious attitudes and to alleviate the problem.",5

363,paper,Achieving SDG2: Political Aspects of Pastoral Vulnerability Among the Afar in Ethiopia,"Sustainable Development Goal 2 relates to ending hunger, achieving food security and improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. The SDGs mention only a few political indicators and SDG2 in particular is largely devoid of political considerations to end hunger and achieve food security. Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen famously observed the absence of famine in democracies, suggesting that a democratic system provides checks and balances that prevent famine. His observation has elicited further debate and triggered empirical studies in recent years. Going beyond Sen’s hypothesis, this essay examines other political factors that would explain vulnerability to famine and that need to be addressed more explicitly in SDG 2 and similar initiatives. By taking the case of pastoralists in the Afar region of Ethiopia, this research explores selected political determinants of vulnerability to famine. The Eritrea-Ethiopia war and the ensuing border closure have had a detrimental effect on the livelihood of pastoralists in Afar – many pastoralists were deprived of a market and a reliable source of income. In addition, Afar pastoralists were sidelined from the informal salt sector on which they used to rely. The state facilitated this expropriation, leaving pastoralists even more vulnerable to famine. I argue that political considerations are crucial in successfully ending hunger and achieving food security. The essay uses a qualitative case study design and is based on a PhD dissertation.",2

Taking into account all the underlying targets of this entry goal, a set of key interactions is then identified between the sdg 2 targets and those of other sdgs, focusing on interactions with high magnitude or strong impacts based on available scientific literature and expert knowledge. The typology and seven-point scale for characterising the range of positive and negative interactions described in the opening chapter to this report is used to assess the selected target-level interactions and the context in which they typically occur. Illustrative examples from different world regions show how these linkages manifest in practice. Policy options that can enhance positive and reduce negative interactions between now and 2030, and beyond are also described.

Lastly, lack of data collection, especially in conflict-affected or otherwise fragile states, was one of the primary limitations of the MDGs. Greater investment in data collection efforts, supported by digital health technologies, is necessary if SDG 3 targets are to be measured and progress assessed. Standardized EMR systems as well as context-specific data warehousing efforts will assist in collecting and managing accurate data. Stakeholders such as patients, providers, and NGOs, must be proactive and collaborative in their efforts for continuous progress toward SDG 3.

As a result, the SDG agenda advocates equity and inclusion while ignoring perspectives on learning that differ from the dominant model; it encourages entrepreneurship while failing to address the broken link between education and employment; it calls for sustainability while remaining silent on the growing aspirations of youth for consumption; and it attempts to ensure accountability through indicators that promote certain learning outcomes over others.

There are still challenges that many regions do not pursue the achievement of sustainable development goals which means that SDGs cannot simply and automatically be achieved in several regions due to different contexts and different geographic backgrounds. Extreme climate change can cause natural disasters that have the potential to cause losses and even claim victims. Thus, Lampung, which is a disaster-prone area, is interesting to be studied whether the government and the community's efforts to realize potential disasters have been accomplished properly. This research explains the efforts that have been and need to be done by Lampung Province in responding to potential disasters through a policy brief in order to motivate the government to pay more attention to climate change and natural disasters. This research is a type of qualitative research with primary data that will be taken by using interview techniques and literature review. The survey was conducted by random sampling the people of Lampung regarding the level of awareness of potential disasters. The data will also be obtained by using Google Trend.

Through the practice of hydro-hegemony, Israel controls all water resources in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, thus denying water sovereignty to the Palestinians. This is demonstrated through three case studies: The Jordan Valley; the West Bank settlements; and Gaza. The politics of water in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory is best understood as part of the dynamics of settler colonialism, in which ethnic cleansing is achieved through the dispossession of essential resources.

Simultaneous autoregressive models were fit to the data to identify associations between TB CNR and poverty, TB testing rates and retreatment rates. CNRs were found to be significantly spatially clustered, negatively correlated to poverty rates and positively associated to TB testing and retreatment rates. Comparing the observed pattern of CNR with model-standardized rates made it possible to identify areas where TB under-detection is likely to occur. These results suggest that TB CNR is an unreliable proxy for TB incidence. Spatial variations in TB case notifications and subnational variations in TB case detection should be considered when monitoring national TB trends. These results provide useful information to target and prioritize context specific interventions.",3

If Kenya is to achieve zero hunger by 2030, it will need efforts to scale up the gains made. Currently, effects of climatic shocks, COVID-19, locust invasion and an economy that is not growing as was expected, continue to exacerbate food insecurity. While there have been gains from the long-term rains over the years, these gains are being lost because of an economy that fluctuates and has been weakened first because of the post-election violence in 2007/2008 and now even more because of covid-19. This weak economy is negatively impacting access, not just to food, but also its availability. It is estimated that by the end of this year, many Kenyans will be food insecure requiring humanitarian assistance. While a majority of Kenyans have access to food, they are still unable to meet the recommended rations. Many Kenyans have access to food that is affordable making diets less and less nutritional. Although Kenya is currently a lower-middle income economy, it still has an estimated 238,000 in the emergency phase . Arid and Semi-Arid lands have the highest levels of food insecurity. Changing climatic patterns have led to poor performance of the short rains. Climate change is impacting negatively on already fragile food security situation. Increasing levels of food insecurity threaten to negate the gains made in Kenya’s progress towards zero hunger. While challenges continue to persist, the United Nations World Food programme works together with the government of Kenya in scaling up efforts towards building a sustainable food system that will ensure sustainability in Kenya’s food and nutrition security. Hence this study seeks to evaluate the role of WFP in attaining SDG 2 in Kenya. The study relied on both primary and secondary data.",2

Some specific challenges identified by participants include maternal, family, cultural conceptions of gender roles and norms as well as workplace diversity. These variables all contribute to a gender and culturally normative ecosystem that present competitive barriers for career development for women.",5

1446,paper,Pursuing the SDG11 targets: The role of the sustainability protocols,"This paper is built on the following research questions: Could the sustainability protocols constitute a solution towards the achievement of SDG11? We underline that, on the one hand, the SDGs are guidelines to support the development of sustainable policies and thus address all elements that may affect them, and on the other hand, sustainability protocols are assessment tools to promote sustainability-conscious design while remaining focused on the built environment. In the Italian regulatory context, the paper highlights how this difference in terms of focus and scale means that they only overlap and mutually reinforce each other with regard to certain aspects, more related to energy and air pollution issues and less to the social aspects of sustainability. Even if there is not always a direct relationship between the evaluation criteria of the protocols and the indicators of SDG11, it is possible to conclude that the sustainability protocols can facilitate the achievement of the SDG11 targets, acting as a key for the implementation of sustainable cities and helping in structuring the process leading to sustainability in a broader framework.",11

SDG 2 aims not only at achieving food security but also at improving nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture. These objectives have been mainstreamed in the recently reformed common agricultural policy and the 'farm to fork' and biodiversity strategies. In developing countries, the EU is strongly committed to achieving SDG 2. The EU institutions and Member States, which collectively provide more than half of official development assistance worldwide, have reaffirmed this commitment in the new European 'consensus on development'. Alongside development aid, the EU has several levers at its disposal to act on food insecurity causes, such as security and defence missions and comprehensive strategies in conflict areas, as well as substantial research capacities. The fact that its internal policies, in particular agricultural, climate and trade policies, have a spill-over effect on other food systems in the world, in particular in poorer countries, also make the EU a significant player.",2

In fact, the definition of UGGp recognises the importance of education as a vital engine to promote a transformative change, lifelong learning opportunities for alland to foster quality inclusive education as expressed by SDG 4 “Quality Education”. The Portuguese UGGp in their own educational offer and in their joint educational activities, based in the targets of SDG 4, developed a set of several educational packages, along with the partnership based in the Educational Program “GEA – Mother Earth”. This aimed to involve school and local communities in a global vision that education is a key to the global integrated framework of the SDGs and plays a central role in a changing world. By demonstrating the educational challenges faced by the Portuguese UGGp in the field of education and their contribution for SDG 4, this paper can be considered an essay about the role of UGGp in this field. It seeks also to find some answers to some of the concerns raised nowadays: what type of education is required in the 21st century? How can UGGp through their educational offer contribute to adapt ourselves to change and to transform the world within which we live in? Can UGGp also contribute to the different dimensions of Sustainable Development through their educational programs and projects? These are some of the issues raised and inspired in the targets of SDG 4 that the UGGp seek to contribute through their educational initiatives.",4

648,paper,Assessing the feasibility of solar microgrid social enterprises as an appropriate delivery model for achieving SDG7,"Delivering SDG7 by providing secure access to modern electricity for over 1 billion people globally demands innovation in technology, policy and delivery models. Microgrids, defined as energy generation and supply systems with maximum capacity of 100kW having capabilities of managing local energy supply, are proving a viable solution for remote rural areas in the global South with no prospect of main grid connection. While steady technological progress in the microgrid sector is being observed, effective planning methodologies and delivery models are key to sustainable microgrid implementation. Social enterprise is a collective term for a range of organisations that trade for a social purpose, and offer a niche innovative energy access delivery model that is neither public nor private sector. This paper proposes an evidence-based analysis methodology for assessing the feasibility of a social enterprise delivery model for the deployment of solar microgrids in a developing country. Steps of the methodology include conducting a site-specific feasibility study; assessing the market potential; and business scale-up scenario modelling. Conclusions and recommendations are given on the opportunity for this novel technical and business solution to address energy poverty and achieve SGD7.",7

The transformations of physical string states are compared with symmetries of self-dual gravity which is the effective field theory of the closed N=2 string. We derive all infinitesimal symmetries of the self-dual gravity equations in -dimensional space–time and introduce an infinite hierarchy of commuting flows on the moduli space of self-dual metrics. The dependence on moduli parameters can be recovered by solving the equations of the SDG hierarchy associated with an infinite set of Abelian symmetries generated recursively from translations. These nonlocal Abelian symmetries are shown to coincide with the hidden Abelian string symmetries responsible for the vanishing of most scattering amplitudes. Therefore, N=2 string theory ""predicts"" not only self-dual gravity but also the SDG hierarchy.",2

This study used desk research to explore what led to its inclusion by analyzing the negotiation process on goal, targets, and indicators. The results show that CSOs demanded a global norm on reducing vertical economic inequality as part of a stand-alone goal. On the other hand, the states part of the UN Open Working Group on SDGs framed inequality merely as social inclusion, to be addressed throughout the framework. SDG 10 was included when developing countries, unsatisfied with the lack of between-country inequality targets, joined CSOs. At face value, the goal conveys a transformative global norm, but this is misleading as states refused a target measuring the gap between the top and bottom incomes. In combination with watered down targets and indicators, this led to a misalignment between the title of the goal and its content.This shows that despite the open nature of the OWG, member states remained by far the most influential decision-makers and successfully used an “ignore-and-reframe” strategy to keep politically sensitive proposals out of SDG10. An exciting avenue to explore further would be whether the inclusion of SDG10 makes a global norm on reducing vertical economic inequality in the future more likely, and what would be needed to achieve this.",10

1213,paper,Implications in the Evaluation of SDG 4: What the Numbers Really Tell Us,"The United Nations has taken the primary role in leading the charge to eradicate poverty around the world. By establishing the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, 169 member nations agreed to work towards poverty eradication and development. The 17 goals each provide targets and indicators, established by the General Assembly, to guide member nations towards achievement. This paper researches the implications associated with monitoring and evaluation of SDG 4, universal quality education, and the ability of developing nations to collect and report on the indicators created for the goal. This research asks the questions, does the data provided give an authentic understanding of the reality of education in Nicaragua?; and what needs to be done, in the case of Nicaragua, in order to best measure SDG 4? To answer these questions, qualitative and quantitative data was gathered from a desk review and interviews with Nicaraguan teachers to create a case study. The case study was then compared to the quantitative data provided for four SDG 4 indicators chosen by the researcher. Comparing the case study to the data, the results found that the data alone did not provide an authentic understanding of the state of education in Nicaragua. The results gathered that the data provided for SDG 4 was minimal due to the lack of political will in Nicaragua, minimal collaboration, inability to collect data, and the disconnect between the SDG 4 indicators and the reality of education in Nicaragua. Because of these barriers to monitoring, evaluation and reporting, the SDGs will find similar results in 2030 as the MDGs did in 2015, minimal progress in low income developing nations.",4

2157,paper,Assessing Progress Towards the Achievement of SDG9,"The U.N.’s perseverance in fostering sustainable industrialisation has not rendered the expected results in the long run. Despite that the scope of SDG9 is reasonably well defined and communicated, there is much more to be done to make it a reality. Achievements on SDG9 have not been as positive as they might have. It should be noted that there is no trustworthy source of information that indicates with certainty the progress towards the 2030 agenda. The purpose of this chapter is to examine factors involved in the SDG9 reporting and other critical issues necessary to understand the progress and how we are progressing towards SDG9. From this point on, data for our debate come from several sources. Still, the primary outcomes come from the 2017 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, the 2020 Voluntary National Reviews reports as well as scientific literature. Unfortunately, there appears to be a lack of reliable SDG9 information available, and what exists is hard to find. In general, information sources often offer qualitative information, and quantitative data are scarce. This situation is especially the case for the documents presented in the chapter, which provided a few statistics disaggregate data, making it challenging to analyse in-depth. The debate here presented does not seek to be a fully comprehensive assessment of their content. The analysis is not designed to interpret or replace the referenced documents, either. Instead, it is intended to illustrate the difficult task of measuring the progress towards SDG9.",9

1145,paper,SDG 2 zero hunger,"The backbone of society and the basis of self-sufficiency is the agricultural advancement of food, fiber, fuel, and industry. However, in many non-industrialized countries, self-sufficiency has been eroded by several factors, including environmental impacts, lack of educational infrastructure, and inequities in resource management and distribution. Additionally, with the rise in human populations and climate pressures, the need to increase food production security and water conservation measures is imminent. By emulating the productivity of natural ecosystems and returning carbon-based materials to the soil, agricultural production may be enhanced with a reduced reliance on potentially water-polluting and often prohibitively expensive synthetic fertilizers. Through various case studies showcasing the effectiveness of educational tools, we work to demonstrate the need for more financial investment in biomass utilization program development in order to cultivate emerging circular economies. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of carbon and ecosystem cycling curriculum in school settings. In situ soil application of organic materials engenders soil carbon sequestration – a climate change mitigation mechanism – and overall soil health and soil water conservation. Compost processing and program development ameliorates potential organic materials pathogen transference while mineralizing nutrients for plant uptake.",2

The impact of aggregate AfT and its different categories is found significant only in low- and lower-middle-income developing countries. The findings also indicate that the impact of AfT is not noticeably different across different regions of the world as well as the religious belief of the developing countries.",5

However, the nutritional outcomes are more nuanced; while participants who had been in the program longer showed higher levels of micronutrient intake, they also consumed elevated levels of prestige items high in sugar and/or salt. Given that participants reported high levels of uncertainty surrounding nutritional information, more education is needed to reverse this trend and decrease the risk of malnutrition development and the associated adverse health outcomes.Conclusions: Microlending platforms may be a viable avenue for disseminating nutrition-related information. However, our data indicate that participants may only be receptive to this information after at least two years of participation because, prior to that, participants are too concerned with income generation, housing stability and their family’s education to fully absorb the information.",2

1003,paper,Understanding health spending for SDG 3,"Although these estimates might be useful for a global dialogue around how SDGs are prioritised in DAH, the approach is less relevant for increased understanding of, and improved decision making in, the health sector of countries included in the study. The authors also acknowledge this aspect as a limitation of their study. Consequently, the Article does not take a health systems approach to the data. Instead, aggregated data on health spending are reported followed by spending in disease categories or, in the case of universal health coverage, covering several diseases. For decision makers in a ministry of health, this way of dividing the funds is not particularly helpful because budgeting systems are commonly constructed on the basis of entities that cut across the health system by expenditure categories and not on disease categories. Further work should seek to develop formats for resource requirements that are aligned with standard government budgeting and we look forward to following the authors work in developing such methods.",3

SDG8, focuses on promoting inclusive economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. The decent work component of SDG8 is anchored on four pillars namely job creation, rights at work, social protection and social dialogue. Notably, the objectives of the SDGs are interlinked with the objectives of the Southern African Development Community which are to achieve economic development, peace and improve the quality of life for Southern Africans. Decent work and economic growth within the SADC region are critical for the respective governments and for regional integration. The SADC region has aligned the SDGs to its existing policies and to other regional and international normative instruments and policy documents in a bid to improve the life and welfare of citizens in the region.
