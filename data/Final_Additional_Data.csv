77	SDG 17 calls for the international community to “strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development,” emphasizing the role of multi-stakeholder partnerships for achieving the SDGs. Policy documents are replete with statements on the necessity of ‘meaningful’ engagement, especially with civil society—without clarifying what ‘meaningful’ stands for. In this article, we develop an analytical approach to partnership as a form and norm of metagovernance. Partnership as a metanorm is about the roles and relations of different sets of actors. We suggest operationalizing the concept of partnership according to different levels of accountability and participation, allowing for a gradual enhancement of the quality of partnership in terms of ‘meaningfulness.’ We apply our analytical model to the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well‐Being for All , a fairly new initiative by health and development agencies to accelerate progress towards the health-related targets of the 2030 Agenda. By investigating the development and the early phase of implementing the GAP, we empirically assess if and how the notion of partnership envisioned in the GAP qualifies as ‘meaningful’ with respect to civil society engagement. From our empirical example, we infer lessons for attaining normative standards of ‘meaningfulness’ and highlight implications for future research on partnerships.	17

98	The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a prospect for the future development of all countries in the world. Its core is to set up the Sustainable Development Goals for the year of 2030, and develop a series of institutional mechanisms around SDGs to promote its implementation. The SDGs include 17 goals, of which SDG 11 is to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Green building can play a positive role in the implementation of SDG 11. However, the entire process of green building development involves multiple stakeholders and various professional fields, which play different roles where may be positive synergies or negative trade-offs in the whole process. This paper uses the nexus approaches to clarify how multiple stakeholders and professions interact with each other in the green building development with the aim of promoting SDG 11.	11

143	This paper assesses the interaction of international trade with climate policies, and the influence of trade on the implementation of SDG 13 . Although international trade contributes directly to GHG emissions, increased trade can help to achieve development goals in a GHG-efficient manner, provided that GHG emissions are correctly priced everywhere. Given that emissions are not universally priced, the paper examines where policies related to trade may be misaligned with or otherwise hindering climate change objectives. While concluding that the multilateral agreements of the World Trade Organization do not generally prevent governments from pursuing strong domestic climate policy, the chapter does identify potential misalignments. These include import tariffs on environmental goods, barriers to trade in services and domestic policies designed to support local low-carbon industry but which are restrictive of international trade and therefore potentially counter-productive. The paper concludes by stressing the importance of building up resilience in the global trade system in the face of increasingly frequent and severe weather-related shocks.	13

The complexity of the language from Aichi target 11 is not mirrored in SDG 14, leading to a potential scenario where the knowledge and progress towards Aichi Target 11 will be diluted as the focus shifts to the SDGs. This paper presents current knowledge and implementation of the qualitative elements of Aichi Target 11 and highlights gaps in knowledge. We conclude that the progress made so far on describing and implementing the qualitative goals of Aichi Target 11 should be integrated into SDG 14 in order to strengthen global efforts for marine biodiversity conservation and support the broader vision for sustainable development that will “transform our world”.	14

297	A large and diverse country like India, where inequality takes on many forms, faces a bigger challenge in attaining SDG 10. In India, there are income inequalities and inequalities of access to opportunities by gender, religion, caste and region. However, based on availability of data, five indicators under SDG targets 10.1, 10.2 and 10.4 have been identified to evaluate the performance of India towards SDG 10. Based on SDG index score for reduced inequalities among 29 states, 3 states are categorised as achievers; 20 states are identified as front runners and 2 states are defined as aspirants. Though India has shown progress in achieving goal 10, it has a long way to go in order to achieve equality between top 10% and bottom 40% of the households in both urban and rural areas.

Achievement of the 17 Goals and 169 targets in the field of sustainable development indicated in it can hardly be conditioned only by the successful and effective policy of each of the UN member states in this direction. This is explained, first of all, by the fact that the implementation of the Agenda envisages both the interaction of countries at a universal level and largely depends on their regional cooperation, including through integration associations. Wherein, the study of the relevant experience of the Eurasian Economic Union as one of the largest regional associations of economic integration is of considerable interest in this matter. The authors consider practical achievement of the mentioned Goals, primarily Goal 8, through the prism of ensuring freedom of movement of labor within the Union and the effective functioning of its common labor market.	8

320	Off-grid renewables data is limited and not sufficiently captured in the energy statistics. The method of allocation of renewable energy consumption from electricity and heat output assumes that the share of transmission and distribution losses are the same between all technologies. However, this is not always true because renewables are usually located in more remote areas from consumption centers and may incur larger losses. 	7

The proposed thirteenth Sustainable Development Goal invites the world ‘to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts,’ while recognizing that the UNFCCC is the primary forum for negotiating a global response to climate change. This SDG13 offers an opportunity to combine multi-leveled actions toward climate change with development objectives. Climate change impacts spare no country but strike unequally developed and developing countries, which raises the question of how adequately the African continent is equipped to respond to climate change challenges, particularly considering Africa’s diverse development needs. Given that African countries present remarkably different contexts, this paper explores climate policies in Africa and discusses opportunities to address concurrently climate change and development challenges on this continent.	13

418	Social inequalities are intensifying globally and widening divisions are linked to civil unrest. Disadvantaged ethnic and religious groups experience poor access to, representation in and outcomes from public services such as healthcare and education. As mechanisms for social participation and citizenship, public services are key to inclusive and sustainable societies. In this paper we present results of a systematic review on strategies for the inclusion of minority ethnic and religious communities, often neglected populations in term of sustainable development activity. We focus on four public service areas: education, health, local government and police services and identify evidence gaps. Our overall aim is to raise awareness and provoke debate, reflection and subsequently action towards the inclusion of disadvantaged ethnic and religious minorities within public services. Public service inclusion strategies were identified through a global evidence review and four country specific reviews conducted by the Socially Inclusive Cities Network - academics, NGOs, policy - makers and practitioners from India, Kenya, Nigeria, Vietnam and the UK. Published evidence was supplemented by country-based and international workshops involving over 230 relevant stakeholders. We specifically explored intersectional experience relating to gender, age and migration status. 56 publications were identified for the global review, mostly in health and education. Macro arena were identified as three distinct but interconnected levels through which exclusion is operationalized. Three overarching frameworks appeared key to successful ethnic and religious inclusion initiatives: accounting for social context; multiple strategies for system reform; and collaboration with disadvantaged communities. Inclusion strategies that address macro, meso and micro level drivers of exclusion are needed to achieve the aspirations of SDG 10. Involving affected communities is key to their success.	10

435	Effective environmental governance is deemed essential in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. However, environmental dimensions have no specific reference across the SDG 16 targets and indicators. In achieving SDG 16—the realization of peace, justice, and strong institution, polycentric environmental governance involving multiple actors across scales deserves thoughtful consideration. This study illustrates the potential of a polycentric approach to environmental governance in achieving SDG 16, using case studies of forest, watershed, and transboundary bushland and seascape management in Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa, namely Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Kenya–Somalia cross-border. By highlighting four key elements of polycentric governance namely, political will, legal framework, support from higher-level governance and capacity building, the case studies demonstrate that polycentric governance play a significant role in achieving three environment-relevant SDG 16 targets, yet these targets are silent about environmental governance dimensions. Since many conflicts arise from the environment and natural resources sector, we suggest that SDG 16 includes indicators specifically directed on polycentric environment and natural resource governance.	16

458	Accomplishing the goal of clean, healthy and productive oceans requires an integrated approach that addresses different pressures and their cumulative impacts holistically. In the context of the EU's SDG monitoring, the indicators focus on bathing water quality, eutrophication and ocean acidification. The EU is committed to improving water quality in marine waters and coastal areas in the sea basins around the EU through a range of land-based and marine policies and by active engagement in Regional Sea Conventions [1]. As a result, some positive trends have been emerging for bathing water quality and the reduction of point-source pollution through improved waste water treatment. Oceans, however, have continued to acidify as a result of global climate change. 	14

The higher value of the line in US dollars reflects the fact that the new PPPs yield a relatively lower purchasing power of that currency vis-a-vis those of most poor countries. Because the line was designed to preserve real purchasing power in poor countries, the revisions lead to relatively small changes in global poverty incidence: from 14.5 percent in the old method to 14.2 percent in the new method for 2011. There are changes in the regional composition of poverty, but they are also relatively small. 	1

623	Within this context, this paper looks at the Spanish National Maritime Security Strategy and the European Union Maritime Security Strategy from a gender perspective as a case study. Both are examined from a three-pronged approach that aims to determine the implications for the implementation of SDG 5.1, 5.2 and 5 C. The first analysis concentrates on their texts and action plans. Since both are sectoral strategies focused specifically on maritime security, but interplay with security strategies of a more generalized scope, the relationship with the Spanish National Security Strategy and the Global Strategy for the European Union’s Foreign and Security Policy is also assessed. Furthermore, the gender dimension of additional maritime security strategies is considered within the European Union and other regional areas in order to have a comparative vision. This work concludes by offering a means of incorporating or improving a gendered perspective in future versions of the Spanish and European maritime security strategies, which can also be applied across different maritime security strategies worldwide.	5

708	At least 40% of the people in the Southern African Development Community region do not have access to safe water and sanitation, rendering them vulnerable to prolonged conflicts and catastrophes, including exposure to water-borne diseases, other pandemics, poverty and human suffering. Although several international and African regional treaties support the human rights to water and sanitation, the ability of the SADC regulatory framework to give effect to these rights is concerning. In fact, available literature on the SADC's ability to meaningfully realise these rights is fragmented and scant. This article examines theoretically a novel governance approach to the implementation of Sustainable Goal 6 of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. The article argues that the coercion through regional 'goal setting' may provide a conclusive, regional response to the continuing development of water and sanitation rights in the SADC region.	6

799	Sustainable and responsible production and consumption are at the heart of sustainable development, explicitly mentioned as one of the sustainable development goals . Life cycle assessment, with its integrated holistic approach, is considered a reference method for the assessment of the environmental impact of production and consumption. This paper presents a study on the environmental impacts of final consumption in Europe in five areas of consumption: food, mobility, housing, household goods, and appliances. Based on the selection of a set of representative products to meet food, mobility, housing, and other consumers’ needs, environmental impacts of products are assessed over their full life cycle: from raw material extraction to production, distribution, use, and end-of-life phase. Life cycle inventories of representative products are multiplied by consumption statistics to assess the impact of an average European citizen in 2010 and 2015. Impacts are assessed considering the sixteen impact categories of the Environmental Footprint method. Results reveal that food is the most relevant area of consumption driving environmental impacts. Use phase is the most important life cycle stage for many impact categories, especially for the areas of consumption housing, mobility, and appliances. For the areas of consumption food and household goods, the most important life cycle phase is related to upstream processes, which corresponds to agricultural activities for food and manufacturing of products components for household goods. Apart from the results, the paper includes a detailed discussion on further methodological improvements and research needs to make use of the Consumer Footprint as an indicator for monitoring SDG 12 and for supporting sustainable production and consumption policies.	12

980	Systems thinking is a mechanism to robustly consider the interconnected world we live in and move away from a ‘siloed’ approach to policy. Similarly, the SDG goals and targets contained in the UN 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development require an integrated approach to diverse human and planetary health challenges. This paper contemplates these efforts and then looks to one of the SDGs considered the least interconnected in SDG analyses: that of ‘life below water’. It examines the Oceans Goal as part of the SDGs and considers in more detail the process of nexus thinking, in particular as it relates to the ocean-climate nexus. This highlights that there are risks in relying on SDG interaction analysis due to skewed results or a failure to accommodate rapid transformation or knowledge gain in certain fields. We suggest that greater recognition of planetary boundary tipping points will enhance the inclusion of oceans in climate considerations, and improve the likelihood of achieving both SDGs 13 and 14.	14

JMP developed the metric of use of 'improved' sanitation facilities, which are likely to hygienically separate human excreta from human contact, and has used this indicator to track progress towards the MDG target since 2000. International consultations since 2011 have established consensus on the need to build on and address the shortcomings of this indicator; specifically, to address normative criteria of the human right to water including accessibility, acceptability, and safety. Furthermore, the safe management of faecal wastes should be considered, as discharges of untreated wastewater into the environment create public health hazards. 	6

1030	Every nation state is struggling hard to improve the living standard of its people so that Pakistan is looking for its people. It is believed that education can bring long lasting and sustainable transformation or change in any society towards better living standards and improve socio-economic conditions. There is consensus among the majority of nations and academia that quality education with inclusiveness and equity is the only tool which can bring a desired change. Education has a very close relationship with the contemporary paradigm shift of education for sustainable development to create critical thinking mindset of the nation to create healthy minds. Literature on sustainability and education demonstrates a causal link with socio-economic development. Academia, society, researchers, scientists, industry and all folks of society are convinced that education is the key tool to bring a change from local to global level in order to curtail contemporary challenges human beings and the planet is facing. A system analysis approach is used to understand logical links among loops. The causal relationship is demonstrated in the form of a Causal Loops Diagram reinforces the idea that education is not only a key driver for introducing more sustainability into the development process, it is also a set of leverage points that should be gradually removed. Therefore, it is understood that quality education is affected by multiple factors to achieve.	4
1031	Rapid urbanization has brought many problems, including housing shortages, traffic congestion, air pollution, and lack of public space. To solve these problems, the United Nations proposed “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, which contains 17 Sustainable Development Goals covering three dimensions: economy, society, and environment. Among them, Sustainable Development Goal 11 , “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”, can be measured at the city level. So far SDG11 still lacks three-quarters of the data required to accurately assess progress towards the goal. In this paper, we localized the indicators of SDG11 and collected Earth observation data, statistical data, and monitoring data at the city and county levels to build a better urban sustainable development assessment framework. Overall, we found that Haikou and Sanya were close to achieving sustainable development goals, while other cities were still some distance away. In Hainan Province, there was a spatial distribution pattern of high development levels in the north and south, but low levels in the middle and west. Through the Moran’s I Index of Hainan Province, we found that the sustainable development of Hainan Province did not yet form part of integrated development planning. The sustainable development assessment framework and localization methods proposed in this paper at the city and county levels provide references for the sustainable development of Hainan. At the same time, it also provides a reference for the evaluation of county-level sustainable development goals in cities in China and even the world.	11

An alternative way of computing a similar quality of service ratio would be to use the percentage of parcels actually delivered within the quality standard, i.e. within the standard for shipping times. The standard for shipping time is the expected end-to-end transit time and is often expressed as the posting day + one, two , three, four or five days depending on the country geography and distance between countries. 	9

1050	The most recent Global Slavery Index estimates that there are 40.3 million people enslaved globally. The UN’s Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goal number 8, section 8.7 specifically refers to the issue of forced labour: ending modern slavery and human trafficking, including child labour, in all forms by 2025. Although there is a global political commitment to ending slavery, one of the biggest barriers to doing so is having reliable and timely, spatially explicit and scalable data on slavery activity. The lack of these data compromises evidence-based action and policy formulation. Thus, to meet the challenge of ending modern slavery new and innovative approaches, with an emphasis on efficient use of resources and is based on freely available and accessible remotely sensed data. From this estimate we can not only calculate the scale of the slavery problem in the Brick Belt, but also calculate the impact of slavery beyond that of the enslaved people themselves, on, for example, environmental change and impacts on ecosystem services – this links to other Sustainable Development Goals. As the process of achieving key Sustainable Development Goal targets will show, there are global benefits to ending slavery - this will mean a better world for everyone: safer, greener, more prosperous, and more equal. This is termed here a Freedom Dividend.	8

1072	So how can policymakers decide which of the five gender inequality indexes is best for tracking their country’s performance on SDG 5? Similarly, how do MNE executives select an index to track their company’s gender equality performance, at home and in their foreign affiliates? We offer three insights into these questions. First, we argue that there is no single right answer. Policymakers and MNE executives need to match their selection of a gender inequality index with the specific gender equality goals and targets they are trying to achieve. The “best” gender inequality index for one government or one MNE may not be the same for another where their goals and targets differ. There may be no “best” index nor “off the shelf” solution; it may be that a single index is not sufficient and will need to be assembled from different indexes. Second, policymakers and MNE executives need to understand why and how the various indexes are constructed; that is, making a “deep dive” into the selection and measurement of indicators and construction of the indexes. A thorough analysis of the various indexes is a necessary first step to selecting or creating an inequality index that best fits the organization. Third, our overall assessment is that, given their strengths and weaknesses, the GII and GGGI are better able to usefully inform policymakers and MNE executives on how to move toward SDG 5 in terms of workplace gender equality. For more holistic measures of gender equality that take account of women’s empowerment, policymakers must look to the new SDG 5 gender indexes. Policymakers should also study Hudson et al.	5

1125	Implementing sustainable development goal 11 in Africa which includes measuring and monitoring social and economic welfare indicators at the city-level requires data of the best quality. In recent years, there have been progress in national statistics and censuses survey yet data gathering in many African countries are not accurate, timely, disaggregated and widely usable. This often diminish the capability of governments to tackle urban development challenges, which are particularly exacerbated by inequality, poverty and uncontrolled development especially in cities. To support knowledge driven decisions and policies there is need to improve data-gathering systems about health, education, and safety, economy and poverty, land, housing and environment, trade and commerce, population and demography. Also, the underlying dynamics, processes, distributions, patterns, trends or disparities inherent in African cities require the breaking down of aggregated data into their component parts or smaller units, which underscores urban data revolution towards achieving SDG 11. In Africa, the process of bringing together diverse data communities to embrace a diverse range of data sources, tools, and innovative technologies, to provide disaggregated data for decision-making, service delivery and citizen engagement is still emerging. Several factors are inhibiting urban data revolution and need to be overturned before we can provide more evidence, more data and more certainty for decision makers towards achieving urban development targets and sustainable cities for Africa. The paper examines the challenge of city-level data-gathering for implementing SDG 11 in Africa. Specifically, it examines the role of cities in implementing SDG 11 in Africa and the need to disaggregate data at city-level; it assesses existing data sources, compilation and dissemination channels as well as the challenges of deploying innovative techniques and strategies including digital and social media platforms and concludes with suggesting sustainable options for evolving cutting-edge strategies for integrating diverse data communities for responsible city-level data-gathering that is reliable, timely, disaggregated and widely usable.	11

1267	In contrast, the lack of adequate warmth appeared to be a problem particularly in southern and south-eastern Europe. This distribution can be traced mainly to poor building energy efficiency, including the lack of suitable heating systems and insulation, leading to higher heating costs. In addition, the generally lower income levels in these regions affect housing standards and the ability to pay for fuel. The existence and design of financial interventions by the respective governments might also play an important role in alleviating energy poverty and helping to keep homes adequately warm 	7

1336	Cities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones. SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to the undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to unsustainable coping strategies and mechanisms. 	13

1354	Sustainable Development Goal 10, Reduce Inequality In and Among Countries, was among the last of the SDGs to be added. SDG 10 was largely a reaction to the increasing attention being paid to the gross disparities of wealth observed around the world, and the political backlash to those disparities. While it can be understood as a call for some redistribution of wealth globally, it is unlikely that large-scale redistribution through taxation or other means is politically feasible as a solution to inequality any time soon. It is more plausibly interpreted as a call for a reduction of inequities - those factors that prevent people and states from having a fair shot at the achievement of prosperity and development. Within nation states, we can see this as a call for a rights-based approach to development - an approach that seeks to give people the capabilities to succeed while also removing the political and social factors, such as discrimination and repression, that prevent them from achieving their potential. Internationally, it is related to the concept of a right to development, which places obligations of assistance on developed states to aid poorer ones. International institutions such as the World Bank and the United Nations have a mandate to promote such rights, and can act as intervening institutions, lending credibility to this drive for the recognition of development rights. The targets set by SDG 10 are more vague and aspirational than those of most other of the SDGs, but the end of gross inequalities of wealth might be seen as a foundational issue that makes many other SDGs possible. As such, SDG 10 imposes particular duties on those parties who can make it a reality.	10

1368	In particular, its targets focus on the implementation of the 10-year framework of programme, the achievement of sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources as well as halving per capita global food waste.	12
1369	Corporate accountability has expanded rapidly in recent years as a tool that business can employ to respond for corporate performance. Nevertheless, the exercise of corporate accountability is challenging as it requires stronger corporate capacity and commitment to respond to external stakeholders in alignment with voluntary regulatory norms. In response, corporate agendas are being significantly shaped by internal and external stakeholders that are employees, suppliers, and customers. Yet, an examination of the current status of accountability both as a historical trend and in current corporate agendas in selected cases shows an increasing gap between policy and impact. Based on a case study method and theory building, the research reported in this article shows the status of corporate accountability of companies operating in Asia-Pacific and adhered to the Global Compact Network.	17

1373	Rapid urbanization, increasingly affluent lifestyles and changing food consumption patterns and overall economic growth trends are increasing the demand for resources and services and exerting increasing pressure on ecosystems all over the Asia-Pacific Region. Ecosystems are threatened throughout the region due to expanding and increasingly intensive agriculture, unsustainable oil palm and rubber plantations, fires, forest clearance, poorly regulated extractives industries, aquaculture and illegal wildlife trade. The total forest area has increased in Asia since 1990 but this figure hides the continuing loss of natural forests behind the expansion of planted forests, and sub-regional trends differ. Southeast Asia, for example, shows an increased rate of forest cover loss as well as a reduction in biomass stocks , despite an increased area of protected forests and stability in areas under forest management plans1. The number of threatened mammal and plant species increased by more than 10 and 18 per cent respectively in the last decade. Rural livelihoods are intimately connected with and negatively affected by the deteriorating health of terrestrial ecosystems. The drivers of land-use change vary between subregions. Larger and more developed countries are more impacted by large-scale agricultural development while smaller countries, especially Small Island Developing States, suffer from land degradation from small scale activities like shifting cultivation or urban expansion from population growth. Degradation of terrestrial ecosystems results in loss of current and future benefits in terms of the multiple services provided by terrestrial ecosystems, including for rural livelihoods, disaster risk reduction, water supply, food security and carbon sequestration. Lastly, a key challenge identified in the ESCAP multi-stakeholder survey2 was the need to ensure community and indigenous people engagement in addressing biodiversity conservation and protection.	15

All volumes reported in the total final consumption table are taken as reported. Since volumes for electricity and heat in the final consumption table are not broken down by technology, electricity and heat output tables are used instead to break down final consumption of electricity and heat by technology. The allocation by technology is done by deriving the share of technology in electricity and heat output tables and multiplying that share by final energy consumption of electricity and heat, respectively. 	7

1441	Notwithstanding the continued emphasis that Botswana has placed on the crucial role of teacher education in being instrumental to the implementation of education reforms, there has been a consistent outcry from all spheres of society on the poor quality of education. Teacher education is key to responding to this outcry that is evident in the rising challenges associated with the national education system which consistently seems to fall short of equipping learners with appropriate skills and competences to respond to the environmental and socio-ecological risks that plight the nation. The environmental socio-ecological risks include water scarcity, energy matters, lately governance issues and an uncertain political climate change and variability, an uncertain economic landscape, quality and relevance of education. Poor quality education has been reflected among others, in poor academic performance in school children, youth restiveness, juvenile delinquency and other anti-social behaviours predominantly in the youth, all of which are aspects contrary to the main objective of Sustainable Development Goal 4 priorities to realize the 2030 framework’s agenda of sustainable development. Using the case of the University of Botswana Faculty of Education Environmental and Sustainability Education unit, the chapter provides some insights into how teacher education can drive SDG 4 implementation through curriculum innovations and professional development to enhance education quality and relevance.	4

1485	This article begins by highlighting the strengths of the Sustainable Development Goals , which guided international action against poverty between 2000 and 2015. Then, through an analysis of SDG 1 - the goal that aims to end poverty in all forms everywhere - it argues that while the SDGs make important advances over the MDGs, they are marred by weakly worded targets that provide little indication of how the goal will be achieved and by whom. This basic flaw, the article further argues, is a reflection of two deeper, foundational problems that apply to the SDGs as a whole. The first is that the SDGs make it easy for governments to go slow on the realisation of human rights, and the second is that the SDGs do not specify a clear division of labour, which is what a human rights-based duty to eradicate severe poverty fundamentally requires.	1

An area is classified as eutrophic if for more than 25% of the observation days of a given year the chlorophyll concentrations as a proxy are above the 90th percentile of the 1998-2017 reference base line. Eutrophication is the process by which an excess of nutrients - mainly phosphorus and nitrogen - leads to increased growth of plant material, particularly algal blooms, in an aquatic body resulting in a decrease in water quality. This can, in turn, cause death by hypoxia of aquatic organisms. Anthropogenic activities, such as farming, agriculture, aquaculture, industry and sewage, are the main source of nutrient input in problem areas. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires Member States to report on eutrophication for their regional seas every six years. The Copernicus Marine Service calculates the indicator from satellite imagery 	14

1726	Associated with this issue, one of the newly specified direct paths suggests there is a positive relationship between the communication of expectation and cooperation. This direct path was identified as most significant in the model. Communication was hypothesized to be mediated through trust. However, more specifically, when referring to the communication of expectations, trust as a mediating variable may not be needed. The scales that contributed to the communication of expectations were associated with formal written agreements and the explicit articulation of the expectations of the parties involved. When the roles and responsibilities are clearly defined trust may not be needed as a mediating factor. Within the case study, written agreements were not deemed as necessary between partners who already had a pre-existing relationship. However, when the large financial investment was required a formal written agreement was deemed essential. As previously stated, cooperation is related to the interdependence between parties, which is aligned with the management of expectations, through a willingness to share tangible and intangible resources.	17

Although the organizations seek to cooperate, this paper shows how this is limited by differences within and between the organizations – differences which relate to their global leadership, their understandings of education, the expertise they draw on, and their approaches to Member States. The paper demonstrates the continuation of an established struggle and interdependency between the organizations as they seek to assert their legitimacy in the context of SDG4.	4

1761	SDG1 presents the global community with an important, but highly challenging goal. When discussing tourism’s potential to contribute to SDG1 to “end poverty in all its forms everywhere”, the multidimensional nature of poverty must be considered rather than focusing solely on economic deprivation. Specifically, we need to shift the focus beyond how tourism can foster economic growth, provide jobs and income, to considering sociopolitical aspects of poverty and how structural inequalities are impeding people’s development. The contradictions involved in poor people, in poor locations, with poor labour rights, putting on smiling faces to serve rich guests of former colonial powers and to clean up their messes, should not be overlooked if we are genuinely interested in challenging the negative aspects of global tourism and making it more equitable and sustainable in the future. Thus, if governments and tourism industry players wish to do more than pay lip service to SDG1, they will need to make some significant changes to the way in which they work. This article will draw inspiration from tourism businesses in Fiji that are addressing SDG1 and related goals, and discuss how they have the potential to contribute to longer-term sustainable development.	1

1884	Cities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones. SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to unsustainable coping strategies and mechanisms. 	1
1885	Tämän tutkielman tavoitteena on tutkia miten suomalaiset yritykset raportoivat arvon jakamisesta ja eriarvoisuuden vähentämisestä SDG 10:n avulla. Tutkimuksessa keskitytään arvioimaan, minkä kontribuutioiden kautta arvo on jaettu, keille arvo on jaettu, ja mitkä ovat yleisimmät teemat arvon jakamisen raportoinnissa SDG 10:n avulla. Tutkimusaineisto on kerätty erilaisista vastuullisuusraportoinnin kanavista 120 suurimmalta suomalaiselta yritykseltä kesäkuussa 2020 julkaistun TE500-listan mukaisesti. Yritykset, joiden raportoinnissa SDG 10 oli esillä, valittiin tarkempaan analyysiin, joka suoritettiin käyttämällä kriittisen diskurssianalyysin menetelmää. Tämän tutkimuksen löydökset osoittavat, että SDG 10 -raportoinnissa suomalaiset yritykset keskittyvät levittämään työntekijöiden tasa-arvoista kohtelua ja varmistamaan yhtäläiset työmahdollisuudet. Arvon jakaminen painottuu työntekijöille erilaisten työllisyyteen, palkkaukseen ja institutionaalisiin työhön liittyvien käytänteiden kautta. Tutkimus esittelee myös uuden arvon jakamisen kanavan, palvelumuotoilun, mitä oli käytetty eriarvoisuuden vähentämisen raportoinnissa. Yleisimpiä teemoja SDG 10:n raportoinnissa olivat yleisesti tasa-arvo ja monimuotoisuus, sekä erityisesti sukupuolten välinen tasa-arvo.	10

1892	The media in Africa have a role to play in the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals by building awareness, setting the public agenda, and influencing and holding to account political leaders. In this chapter, we examine the problematic context of a commercialised and privatised media system playing a significant role in debates about development and in development education and advocacy—topics which are not necessarily profitable. Media can play a role as public information channels, engagement platforms, watchdogs and advocates for policy improvement—all crucial to the successful implementation of the SDGs—but media do not necessarily fulfil these obligations. With advances in technology, the power of the media to open new opportunities to drive social change and to transform development in Africa is unsurpassed. We explore how the contemporary political economy of Kenyan media challenges or supports such objectives. We also examine how information gaps concerning SDG goals, such as climate information in rural communities, pose a challenge to the realisation of the SDGs. We conduct an investigation into the form of analysis of media coverage of climate change and action in Kenya, but draw primarily from existing research concerning Kenyan media. Our findings show that the Kenyan media are ill-equipped to specifically support SDG 13 on climate change and action in the country.	13
1893	The UN Commission on Sustainable Development  addressed risk management and vulnerability in the context of its thematic issues of water, sanitation and human settlements in its 2004-2005 cycle and then in the context of drought and desertification in its 2006-2007 cycle.	11

1953	Estimated trends in fishing pressure To ensure fish stocks are exploited sustainably, the CFP aims to rebuild stocks above levels at which they can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). MSY is determined by the long-term average stock size that allows fishing at this level. The indicator shows the model-based median value of current fishing mortality (F) relative to the estimated maximum sustainable yield (FMSY), expressed with the term F/FMSY. Values below 1 indicate sustainable fishing levels (F ? FMSY). The modelled trend for the total EU waters is dominated by the more stable situation in the North-East Atlantic, while the heavier fishing pressure in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea has lower weight in the model. Time series data on fishing mortality are provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). 	14

Ending gender-based violence is one of the key objectives of the EU Gender Equality Strategy 2020- 2025. It is also a subject of the European Parliament resolution on the situation of women with disabilities 	5
1998	Given the above, this paper should be seen as one step further in the process of indicator design which may inspire the formal SDG review process. The novelty and complexity of the SDG framework opens a wide range of research avenues, of which we highlight three. First, the threshold values proposed here do not say much on whether countries are on the right track to achieve SDG-2 targets, unless monitored over a longer period. Although SDG targets are the same for all countries, the pathways they will follow will differ. Historical trends may offer hints on a country’s future, but there is no guarantee that past trends will persist. Second, synergies and trade-offs across SDGs and analytical scales should be examined to inform coherent policy design under different scenarios. Third, agricultural trade among the countries examined in this paper deserves greater attention and has direct implications for nutrition and environmental indicators, especially when food access and availability are considered over the short and long terms. In all cases, the identification of research methodologies well-suited to tackle the spatial and temporal scalar complexity of sustainability targets is crucial.	2

2197	SDG 8 covers conventional economic policy goals like GDP growth and employment for which governments established agencies compiling the relevant data long ago. Since many years, national and international research institutes engage in forecasting economic activity to provide guidance for economic policy. The goals summarised in SDG 8, however, go also beyond conventional economic indicators, extending them to inclusive and sustainable growth and decent work for all. Indicators reflecting a broader view on the labour market, like the “inactive population due to caring responsibilities” or covering information on “people killed in accidents at work” or the “work at-risk-of-poverty rate” now complement traditional economic variables. Some of these indicators, however, are published with considerable time lag and there is not yet an established regular forecasting process covering them. The lack of timely information became obvious in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the lockdown measures, necessary to confine the spread of the virus, did not only create a steep decline in economic activity but also had consequences on the amount of caring responsibilities within families, when schools switched from class room to digital teaching. In addition to the negative consequences for employment, the sharp economic downturn also weighed on working income due to the reduction in working hours or the partial income loss associated with short-time work schemes. The strong interaction between labour market data and the disposable income of private households creates synergies between the nowcasting of key and multipurpose indicators in SDG 8. Whereas the rapid design and implementation of fiscal policy measures has been supported by nowcast information based on very high-frequency data , up-to-date indicators highlighting beyond GDP goals have only been partially available. Especially ecological indicators are published with a delay, which impedes timely monitoring and quick policy intervention.	8

Nevertheless, institutional voids may undermine this potential to abate inequality. Sustainable banking can bridge these institutional failures. We provide empirical evidence drawn from a database of 46 developed and developing countries over the period 2010-2017. We find that sustainable banking reduces income inequality within countries with weak formal institutions. These findings contribute to the literature by providing novel insights into the sustainable banking-income inequality abatement nexus, and the crucial influence of institutional quality on this linkage.	10

2332	The paper describes the Global Water Partnership partner experience in the introduction of risk-based Integrated Water Resources Management , and water security. The concept of ‘sustainable management’, in the Russian version of Water SDG6, is translated as ‘rational use’ but no one can explain why. We suggest that such a misunderstanding happened since Ukrainian decision-makers still perceive themselves only as water users who are not obligated to achieve any development goals. Therefore, they are quite comfortable with the existing normative approach to water management where the objectives are compliance with defined norms and ensuring water security, which is understood as an absence of any water risk solely to humans, rather than the environment at large. Keeping in mind that true science starts with measurable values, and recognizing that you cannot manage if you cannot measure, we propose to change this false understanding of water security and sustainability that is inherent in the outmoded concept of ‘rational use’. Such a shift is only possible by switching to a measurable goal-oriented approach and risk management in water policy.	6

2336	Goal 11 of the Sustainable Development Goals sets out to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable by 2030. Together with the New Urban Agenda adopted at the Habitat III conference in Quito in 2016, SDG 11 is the latest emanation of the thickening layer of international normative guidance on questions of sustainable development and urban governance. This chapter argues that Goal 11 of the SDGs is a clear expression of the urban turn, as it were, in global governance. The contribution contextualizes the setting in which SDG 11 is inserted as well as the aspirations of Goal 11. The chapter also unearths the inherent contradictions of SDG 11 since not all of its sub-goals will be attainable at the same time and without negatively impacting on some of the other SDGs. For instance, the notions of ‘safety’ and ‘inclusiveness’ might well conflict with each other. The chapter concludes with a critical view on some of the general implementation risks and challenges associated with SDG 11.	11
2337	This study is an endeavor to examine the causes of rising inequality in India at the sub-national level and thus to arrive at policy implications in order to achieve targets under SDG 10. In a country like India, with striking heterogeneity, examining inequality at the more disaggregated level and understanding its causes is essential for sound policy making. Since the beginning of the economic reform in 1991, there has been a rising income inequality in India has been a cause for concern. Owing to opening up of the economy, the growth rates in states output have increased rapidly especially after 1993. This seems to have widened the income gap. However, thus far only a few studies have attempted to analyze the causes of rising inequalities in Indian states. This study, analyzing data from 18 major Indian states, finds that, in the post reforms period, structural transformation and trade liberalization cause inequality to increase in Indian states. On the other hand, the evidence on infrastructure leading to rise in inequality has to be dealt with caution on account of the presence of outliers. These results are believed to have important policy implications.	10
2338	The international community has adopted and endorsed an ambitious global development agenda for the period 2015–2030 in the Sustainable Development Goals , and the bulk of those budgets go to recurrent expenditure rather than development investments. In Sub-Saharan Africa, military expenditures account for a greater share of public funds. This paper suggests that while policy makers in both the Global South and North treat food security and agricultural development as priorities, these remain in a relatively low position on policy agendas because other concerns respond to much stronger constituencies.	2

The use of PPPs rather than market exchange rates ensures that differences in price levels across countries are taken into account. However, it cannot be categorically asserted that two people in two different countries, living below US$1.25 a day at PPP, face the same degree of deprivation or have the same degree of need. This poverty line is not appropriate for high-income economies and may not be appropriate for upper-middle income countries. 	1

2356	Digital Synchronous transmission occurs when people are communicating with each other at the same time, via various forms of communication technologies. Networked teaching needs to establish certain teaching situation which is the use of network resources platform, collaborative and autonomous learning platforms. Network autonomous learning is learners and online learning materials, teachers, classmates on one-to-many interactive session, in most of the universities, fundamental constraint where not addressed to include synchronous interface and session retrieval. While we openly admit deficiencies of the present network technology in teaching in our various institutions as to have met a lot of problems, the students and teachers generally reflect on the problems and that has become the main problems affecting the performances of network teaching. At present the Universities sites and project learning website have many problems existing in the teaching material and method of processing. Of all the project-based learning website, Colleges and Universities Open Distance Learning, a lot of material on the website is only the original physical textbooks to realize a simple heuristic teaching method in teaching materials, control of the learning process is mainly in computer without synchronous flexible design. Students use network resources for independent learning, visitor and teachers, communication and coordination between visitor and resource is particularly important. But at present teaching websites for teachers and students are non-interactive, non-synchronous and some of the interactive system is in a state of idle nomenclature, making the network teaching lost a very important part of the teaching process. The entire essence of this paper is to propose a better networked e-learning and collaborative synergy in a more active synchronous and asynchronous participation to fully achieve different kinds of learner’s expectations.	4

2374	System dynamics models have become reliable tools in developing and accessing robust education policies, particularly through their capacity to capture and quantify complexity and cross-sectoral dynamics. In Pakistan, addressing the multi-faceted education sector has been a challenging task for policy-makers and the country has been underperforming in its progress to achieve SDG 4. By using SD models with a track-record of real-life application, such as the T21 and iSDG models reviewed in this paper, the country has the opportunity to advance a comprehensive development agenda and simultaneously evaluate and improve the efficiency of its implementation. Future research on the use of SD models for education in Pakistan that would address data inconsistencies, locally tailored methods for participatory approaches in the modelling process and conceptual frameworks on improved model structures can contribute to the development of a valuable policy-guiding tool. Such efforts would not only enable Pakistan to move towards achieving its SDG 4 targets, but it would also allow policy synergies to help the country in implementing its overall SDG agenda.	4

L’inclusion de l’apprentissage tout au long de la vie fait naître l’espoir d’un rôle renforcé de l’AEA dans les politiques et programmes mondiaux en matière d’éducation. En principe, les dix cibles de l’Objectif 4 ouvrent des possibilités explicites pour l’AEA. Mais l’auteure invite à être sceptique quant au fait que les ODD accorderont une plus grande importance que les OMD à l’AEA, en particulier à l’approche fondée sur les droits fondamentaux. L’article est structuré en trois sections. La première retrace l’émergence en tant que modèle mondial d’une approche de l’éducation des adultes fondée sur les droits, et met l’accent sur le rôle de l’UNESCO. La seconde section analyse comment l’approche de l’éducation des adultes fondée sur les droits est contestée par d’autres acteurs dans le domaine de l’éducation pour le développement. Dans la dernière section, l’auteure s’appuie sur les données empiriques récentes pour explorer le rôle de l’apprentissage et de l’éducation des adultes à l’heure des Objectifs de développement durable.	4

Economic vitality is made through different policies, such as trade and employment, are influenced by food systems and vice versa. The environmental sustainability occurs through the protection of ecosystem services and natural capital that in turn have co-benefits with food systems. Social inclusion and human health are very much dependent on food security, nutrition, food culture and animal welfare. Although one change in the system may bring multiple outcomes, these outcomes may not all be what is considered progress. A nutritional intervention may have an unintended consequence for environmental, economic, and social outcomes or an economic incentive may have profound impacts on the environment or natural resource base.	2

2462	Climate change is a global priority. In 2015, the United Nations incentivise individuals to act based upon the auditing outcomes, in order to avoid or justify politically controversial restrictions that may be seen as bypassing the creativity of developers. The idea is thus to find a practical solution that can be implemented in software design that incentivises and rewards and that respects the autonomy of developers and designers to come up with smart solutions. This paper proposes such a sustainability management mechanism by introducing the notion of ‘Sustainability Budgets’—akin to Privacy Budgets used in Differential Privacy—and by using these to introduce a ‘Game’ where participants are rewarded for designing systems that are ‘energy efficient’. Participants in this game are, among others, the Machine Learning developers themselves, which is a new focus for this problem that this text introduces. The paper later expands this notion to sustainability management in general and outlines how it might fit into a wider governance framework.	13

2488	The analysis of the existing monitoring activities shows that the greatest challenges causing data gaps are associated with the novelty of most indicators as well as their complexity. There are no conceptual problems concerning the indicator’s methodologies but rather challenging conditions that complicate data collection. A key element in increasing data availability within the next years is national capacity-building since national data builds the basis for monitoring the global indicators. In addition, the extent of data sources can be expanded for example by aligning national and regional initiatives with the global goals, enabling common monitoring efforts and thereby reducing the countries’ reporting burden. In this context, the Protocol on Water and Health can potentially increase data availability in the pan-European region. The comparison of the SDG 6 indicators and the current reporting template of the Protocol indicates that there are already aspects that require very similar data. However, slight modifications could enhance these overlaps and facilitate the common use of national monitoring capacity and collected data. The comparison of current country reports and the latest JMP progress reports suggests that several Parties of the Protocol do not fully exploit this potential.	6

2530	The role of the financial sector is central in reducing income inequality – the goal of SDG 10 – by facilitating economic opportunities. However, institutional weaknesses may also undermine this effect. We argue that sustainable banking generates bidirectional trust to overcome institutional weaknesses, particularly the weak rule of law. Empirical evidence from 46 countries aggregating data of 1060 banks over 2010–2017 shows that sustainable banking lessens income inequality in weak rule of law settings. The results are robust after including the effects of bank digitalisation. This study has important implications for sustainable banking expansion into weak institutional environments and demonstrates banks’ efforts in their commitment to reducing inequality.	10

2568	It is well-evidenced that women earn less than men; however, the incessant effects of the gender pay disparity egregiously continue into retirement. Women in Australia retire with approximately half the superannuation balance of men; consequently, this chapter is preoccupied with understanding the reasons for the gender disparity in retirement , this chapter critically engages with how superannuation policy can be ameliorated and reformed to facilitate the diverse career trajectories and primary care responsibilities many women face. In line with SDG sub-target 10.2, the empowerment and promotion of economic inclusion, irrespective of age, sex, race etc., this chapter stresses the integral role that financial education and literacy play in enabling women to better understand the vital function of superannuation savings in preparing for a sustainable retirement. Finally, the latter section of this chapter explores how superannuation policy can be structurally amended to consider the oftentimes broken and disparate career trajectories women face.	10

2705	We distinguish cost of supply, a supply dimension, as distinct from affordability, an energy poverty dimension. This is because cost of supply, both for connections and regular use, reflect service providers' efficiency, subsidies from government and the related political economy of the sector. People who cannot afford the cost of available energy are likely to remain excluded from access. Cost of supply can vary spatially or for different categories of customers depending on geographic factors should ideally be collected from energy suppliers. Tiers for this dimension could then be defined as deviations from an average value, with thresholds defined as plus or minus a multiple of the standard deviation around the mean. One way to approach this indicator is to use national benchmarks for utilities and service providers based on best practices within countries or regions. In the application presented later for Ethiopia, India and Rwanda, we do not operationalize this indicator, as data for this was not consistently available across the three nations.	7

2770	This chapter proposes the use of the sustainable livelihood framework as a powerful conceptual approach for research aimed at understanding the interaction between global investment, local livelihoods and poverty reduction in resource regions. The chapter applies the SLF as a tool to develop recommendations for poverty alleviation, showing how it can contribute to SDG 1 No Poverty. The innovative application of the SLF helps us understand the ways in which key areas of research connect and interact as constituent components inherent in the framework. This chapter also argues that this framework helps increase our understanding of the ways communities build capacity to forge sustainable livelihoods in resource regions. It thus presents a justification for the use of the SLF, followed by an examination of the SLF principles, their implications for communities and relevance for empirical research in this field. The chapter also shows the way in which the SLF can be modified for application to local circumstances through case studies conducted in two resource regions of Colombia. Nevertheless, the findings of the research can be applied to other resource locations elsewhere.	1

2798	In order to reduce poverty and achieve Goal 1 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, countries’ foreign trade flows must be a driving force for productive activity, as proposed by the WTO-led Aid for Trade initiative. This work analyzes the evolution of international trade in goods and services between Africa’s Least Developed Countries and customers and suppliers from other countries between 2005 and 2015, based on the information provided by UNCTAD and the World Bank. The results confirm a greater degree of trade openness and especially an increase in service imports. Overall, the data show that the purchases made in the international market have a greater marginal effect on GDP than sales, leading to the conclusion that changes in trade policy are needed, at both international and national level. Actions should be aimed at ensuring that the growing integration of these economies in the world trade system does not result in continued deficits in the trade balance but, on the contrary, does contribute to GDP growth and poverty reduction.	1

2800	This study examined the linkage effects of foreign direct investment estimation technique was used to analyse the effects of FDI inflows on different sectors of Nigerian economy. The study found that only the manufacturing sector produced insignificant positive effects on real GDP while FDI inflows into mining, construction and agricultural sectors have insignificant negative effects on real GDP as demonstrated in their coefficients and probabilities. Hence, the study concluded that there is a minimal linkage effect of FDI inflows into Nigerian manufacturing sector while no notable linkage effect of FDI inflows into mining, construction and agricultural sector was found in the Nigerian economy. The study, therefore, recommended that, to achieve Goal-17.3, the developed nations would need to be attracted to mobilise additional financial and technological resources, and invest these in the Nigerian economy in order to strengthen her domestic resource mobilisation and sustain economic growth of the host economy.	17

2802	"The livelihoods of more than 30 per cent of the total population in India residing in nine maritime states and four Union Territories are dependent on the diverse ecosystem services offered by coastal and marine systems. Marine fisheries contribute significantly to the Indian economy through the foreign exchange from the export of seafood which corresponds to nearly 5 per cent of the overall export and 20 per cent of the agro-export. In recent times, the anthropogenic pressures due to extensive marine fishing introduce challenges in the marine environment. Marine anthropogeomorphology, capable of transforming the natural settings of the continental shelf dominantly, is often not studied in detail from the perspective of sustainable fishing. For example, the use of the assorted fishing gears can damage the sea floor, apart from the capture of juvenile and non-target fishes. Bottom trawling by mechanised crafts as a part of marine fishing affects the geomorphology of the continental shelf and continental slope by displacing boulders, interrupting the structure of the sediment column, resuspending sediments, and imprinting deep holes on the muddy sea bottom. Occasionally, the abandoned fishing nets/gears on the seafloor are also responsible for the geomorphological damages to the bottom of the sea and death of several marine benthic flora and fauna, a phenomenon referred to as ""ghost fishing"". Further, Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated is the nodal agency, which disseminates PFZ advisory since 1999 using remotely sensed datasets of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a to reduce the uncertainty during marine fishing. PFZ advisory can help to promote environment-friendly fishing by reducing the search time and hence, ensuring minimal damage to the marine environment."	14

Finally,the article reviews SDG 15, 'Life on Land', against the backdrop of the prior decolonizing and convivial perspectives. The article argues that Illich's conviviality and related ideas have much to offer in envisioning alternative, decolonizing conservation ideas by promoting grassroots, democratic decision-making, living within bounds by the rich, emphasizing interdependencies between and within people and the environment, yet need to avoid imposition and incorporate intergenerational and marginalized viewpoints adequately.	15

2822	Indicators, including the global indicators, are designed as measures of accountability. Such frameworks require the confidence and trust of those who are implementing them. National governments and, more fundamentally, teachers and schools should therefore be in the driver’s seat in developing measures of accountability that are politically acceptable, professionally sound, and administratively manageable. However, as we noted previously, discussion about indicator development and measurement has been largely treated as a technical exercise and thus avoided discussion about the politics of measurement: who sets the agenda, who monitors, who collects data, who interprets the data, who is to be held accountable and for what. Neglecting such considerations runs the risk of disempowering national education actors and citizens who should, in the final instance, be leading the agenda. After all, policy traction and accountability provided by global targets only work if national governments use the information from monitoring progress to put in place education policy reforms to improve education quality.	4

2907	Climate change is one of the hottest topics on the globe as of right now. The deadline of reaching both the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement is getting closer, and actions are needed. This thesis focus on how two countries, Sweden and the United Kingdom are working towards achieving goal 13 of the Sustainable Development Goals. Policies, implementations of policies and actions are assessed. The study is a comparative case study that is based on secondary data presented by each country in official reports, the annual Sustainable Development Report as well as the Nationally Determined Contribution report by each country. The International Regime Approach is the theoretical framework used for consideration and comparison between the actions and non-actions by the two countries, where the relationship to the European Union plays an important role. The findings of the study shows that both Sweden and the United Kingdom is passionately working towards achieving the climate goals and has pointed out relevant policies and actions to meet the SDGs. Progress has been made in both countries as emission rates has been radically reduced but despite their devotion, both countries are far from reaching the climate goals as the overall progress of implementation of policies are not on satisfactory levels.	13

2938	In the neighbourhoods sampled in both cities, about a third of participants in each settlement had built their houses themselves, while the second most common mode of access was the purchase in Luanda and inheritance in Maputo of previously self-built houses. A minority of participants we found that in the areas studied in both cities there is no correlation between tenure status and access to basic services. This was especially the case in Maputo, where on average 85% of participants had access to basic services such as water through a tap at home, even in the more precariously built and densely populated areas where residents lacked formal tenure, against an average of 51% in Luanda. Upgrading interventions did improve access to basic services in Luanda, with residents of an upgraded neighbourhood having gained almost universal access to water at home, compared to less than 10% in another neighbourhood, although levels of formal tenure were equally low in both places. This raises questions about the usefulness of using the proportion of the urban population living in informal settlements as an indicator for measuring access to housing and basic services.	11
2939	Poverty is one of the most tremendous problems of the modern world community. This is a condition in which people are not able to satisfy the range of bare necessities, and therefore not only eat a wholefood diet, but also study, find a job, provide for their family.

2999	Five of our participants had been involved with charities. Some of them collected donations for local charities. A female academic in Sanandaj worked with two charities, one of which looked after unmarried women or women in abusive relationships. Charity-related activities together with missionary work and bible study in Manila were perceived as “extension”, which is how the TM is referred to in HE institutions in the Philippines. Academics appeared to associate the notion of public engagement with the duty of care. As we have indicated in the section on impact of SDG5 in HE and women’s roles in academia in this paper, we find this quite problematic and different from the remit of the TM. According to our definitions of the TM, charity work would not be considered an engagement activity because it refers more to a personal choice of community engagement and individual care. To count as a form of TM, charity work would need to be a knowledge-based intervention, a type of engagement that requires expert academic knowledge and procedures, reflected in the university mandate and made available to all academic staff. From our participants’ responses, charity work meant providing assistance rather than a knowledge-based intervention, and it featured more with female academics and less with male colleagues.	5

3041	Many countries in Latin America confront high levels of inequality, the impacts of climate change and unequal access to quality nutritious foods. Historically, the most vulnerable populations are impacted disproportionally. Climate change exacerbates these inequalities and vulnerability to food insecurity. Worldwide trends highlight the urgent need for context-specific actions that reduce climate risks and impacts, and these are crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals agreed to under Agenda 2030. This chapter highlights a range of solutions that have been introduced to increase community resilience in La Guajira, Colombia, and the implications for the food security and nutrition of the most vulnerable. Our case solutions show that sustainable rural development and resilience building start with a paradigm shift toward more appropriate land use and integrated climate resilience development pathways. This requires a combination of technological advances, new concepts of equitable welfare and local, national and international cooperation. To scale up resilience building, local knowledge, participation and experiences must be a crucial component to rural development and adaptation planning in Colombia and the region. Climate change is forcing action, and solutions exist. However, there is no time to waste in identifying, sharing and implementing community-led solutions.	2

Freshwater availability has declined and quality of drinking water has deteriorated, leading to increase in water-borne diseases. The decaying water infrastructure results in a 40pc water loss in conveyance from dams to farms, for agricultural development. Industrial, agricultural, and household chemicals are freely imported and used without any regulatory system. Massive depletion of natural resources has meant the cutting of trees, resulting in increased timber imports. Pakistan National Action Plan .

3220	Driven by the desire to mitigate climate change and reduce overdependence on fossil fuels, biofuels have been actively pursued in recent years because they are believed to be inherently environmentally friendly. In the past few years, however, critics have objected to the basis for which it should be adopted due to potential negative trade-offs. Sustainable Development Goals number seven seeks to substantially increase contribution of renewable energy to global energy supply, as well as double the rate of improvement in efficiency of energy. Biofuels are likely to play a key role in the pursuit of these goals being one of the most advanced alternative energy sources. This review assesses the potential of biofuels to contribute to the set SDGs by presenting an appraisal of their development over the years. It sheds light on some main arguments surrounding biofuels from the perspective of proponents and critics alike. Even though biofuels have a great potential in aiding climate change mitigation, its large scale adoption is regarded as problematic in its current state. This is because of its potential negative trade-offs in terms of land use change and emissions, especially for first and second generation biofuels. However, a combination of plant biology, carbon capture techniques and novel bioconversion processes provided by third and fourth generation biofuel technologies have set open an era of fuels that will be abundant, energy efficient and clean to support the seventh SDG.	7

The following paper presents the case of Egypt’s reporting on SDG 16 implementation as a case in point. SDG 16 is one of the most sensitive goals to report on, especially in developing non-democratic countries. Through reviewing published reports and studies by both international and national agencies, the current research paper explores to what extent Egypt has progressed with the achievement of SDG 16 indicators. Findings point out to deficiencies in government reporting yet the availability of alternative reliable proxy measures. The paper concludes with recommendations for the international community to recognize the politics in evidence-based policy making, and for the civil society, academia and research centers to play a more active role in monitoring and reporting on the politically sensitive indicators of the SDG 16.	16

3300	Sustainable Development Goal 7 aims to â€œensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for allâ€ by 2030. India is home to the worldâ€™s largest population without access to modern energy â€“ 400 million people do not have access to electricity and 800 million people still cook with traditional biomass. In this context, this study analyses the potential to embed the SDG 7 target of universal access to clean fuels and technologies into Indiaâ€™s national agenda. The analysis of the present paper shows that at the current pace of deployment of clean cooking technology, it seems unlikely that India will meet the SDG 7 target by 2030. In order to progress towards achieving this target, India needs to adopt a two-pronged technological approach â€“ access to modern cooking fuel needs to be increased alongside efforts to make traditional cooking fuels safer to use. Consumer affordability, access and awareness all remain large barriers to the successful uptake of clean cooking technologies. There exists a lack of intra-governmental coordination, and existing networks are not effectively utilised. Non-governmental stakeholders have a key role to play in facilitating market finance, robust â€˜last-mileâ€™ distribution, community engagement, awareness-raising and after-sales services. Current data monitoring mechanisms also need to be modified so as to effectively track progress towards the SDG 7 target.	7

3308	As the indicator components are not measured by gender, it is not possible to disaggregate this indicator by gender. However, it is especially indicator 6.4.2 which is important for gender equality issues, since water scarcity disproportionately affects women, particularly in developing countries, and jeopardizes the achievement of their human rights. 	6
3309	The importance of transport for climate action is further recognized under the UNFCCC - the transport sector will be playing a particularly important role in the achievement of the Paris Agreement, given the fact close to a quarter of energy-related global greenhouse gas emissions come from transport and that these emissions are projected to grow substantially in the years to come.	11

3322	The inequality focus, has for the most part, centred on women and on poverty, however, and discussions of SDG 10 have paid little in-depth attention to ethnic and religious exclusion despite the overrepresentation of ethnic and religious minorities amongst the poorest communities . [...] inequities in service provision and outcomes Macro- and meso-level barriers are associated with, and reinforced by, community and micro-level factors such as poverty, lower system understanding and concordance, greater fear and mistrust of services and lower literacy, capacity, social and cultural capital and disempowerment among disadvantaged ethnic and 8 religious groups. [...] In the education sector, effective interventions supported the inclusion of students from ethnic and religious minorities through the provision of additional tutoring for individual students, increased parental involvement in the school and the introduction of social- psychological interventions to address students’ vulnerability to ‘stereotype threat’ i.e. [...] In Odisha State, a mix of strategies including expanded provision of health services, training of health workers and the introduction of cash transfer and entitlement schemes addressed macro, meso and micro-level factors and led to reductions in health inequalities for ethnic minorities and more generally. [...] Mapping inclusion initiatives on to the various drivers of exclusion within the model should in theory increase the potential of such initiatives to improve the experience of minority ethnic and religious groups and individuals.	10
3323	Cities will play a pivotal role in determining whether the Sustainable Development Goals realize their transformational potential. A lack of data from cities may nonetheless weaken the policies and monitoring systems needed to realize that promise. This article examines whether “environmental” data exists for SDG 11 in 18 cities in Japan and 10 cities in the Philippines and proposes empirically-grounded recommendations to help close data gaps. It finds a lack of good environmental data for SDG 11 in Japan and the Philippines; it also finds that the data gaps are more pronounced in the Philippines than Japan. In the Philippines, the most significant challenges involve air quality, public transport, and green space data as well as systematizing and standardizing the collection of time-series data. To help close identified gaps, the article recommends working with existing platforms to enhance intercity learning and strengthening support from national statistical agencies for standardized reporting of key data over multiple years. In Japan, the greatest challenges involve collecting data in smaller cities, especially for air pollution and adequate housing indicators. Our findings suggest Japan’s national statistical agencies should offer targeted support from the national statistical agencies for smaller cities and estimating figures from existing statistics for air quality and housing data. While these findings come from a review of Japanese and Philippines cities, they may also apply to other cities in the developed and developing countries. All cities may want to prioritize context-appropriate proxies rather than expending scarce resources on data with limited relevance.	11

Reducing the wide gender employment gap, which measures the difference between the employment rates of men and women aged 20 to 64, is important for equality and a sustainable economy. Women tend to be more highly educated than men in most EU countries. Despite this, women are still paid less, as evidenced by the persistent gender pay gap. Women in the EU are over-represented in low-paid sectors and under-represented in well-paid sectors. Because of the gender pay gap, and interrupted and shorter working lives, women earn less over their lifetime than men. The correlation between women's lower employment rate and caring responsibilities aggravates their risk of poverty and social exclusion, especially in old age. 	5

3573	Air emissions intensity of industry This indicator measures the emissions intensity of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) from the manufacturing sector (NACE Rev. 2 sector 'C'). Air emissions are defined as flows of gaseous and particulate materials emitted into the atmosphere. Fine and coarse particulates (PM10) are less than 10 micrometres in diameter and can be carried deep into the lungs, where they can cause inflammation and exacerbate the condition of people suffering from heart and lung diseases. Fine particulates (PM2.5) are less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter and are therefore a subset of the PM10 particles. Their negative health impacts are more serious than PM10 because they can be drawn further into the lungs and may be more toxic. Emission intensity is calculated by dividing the sector's PM emissions by its gross value added (GVA), which is defined as output (at basic prices) minus intermediate consumption (at purchaser prices). 	9

4443	Sport and food can be potent agents of health, well-being, and community cohesion. However, as both have scaled up, their animating aims and impacts have shifted. The two are instrumentally connected: without adequate food, athletic pursuits are impossible, elite performance unattainable, and fanship impracticable. Thus, the central “zero hunger” aim of Sustainable Development Goal 2 is highly relevant to sport. Sport organizations often address hunger via charity. While these well-intentioned efforts meet immediate need, they do not address the systemic causes of hunger and food insecurity. As a result, they may unintentionally enable hunger to persist. Sport organizations working toward SDG 2 should reorient their efforts toward mutually reinforcing policy advocacy and community-level action. Building on the food citizenship for food security framework, the authors present several recommendations to use their financial resources, public profiles, and political influence to amplify the work of food justice activists who pursue structural change and community empowerment, ultimately replacing hunger with equity.	2

4446	The UN predicts that 68% of the world population will live in urban areas by the year 2050, up from 55% at present. Cities contribute to 70% of the world economy with proportional energy consumption and consequent carbon emission. According to the World Bank, the cities will generate 3.4 billion tons of solid waste by 2050, up from 2 billion in 2016. i.e., cities and communities are the most vulnerable and the largest contributors to the climate change, therefore, enough reasons to concentrate on the 11th UN SDG of “sustainable cities and communities”. The SDG11 aims for affordable and sustainable housing and transport; mitigates extreme weathers and natural disasters, greening of public spaces, and resources efficiency; reduces the environmental impacts of cities; and enhances the resiliency of cities and communities. Undeniably, growing consumption is akin to urbanization and modern ways of living, thereby making cities as the largest contributors of carbon emission and environmental hazards. The solid material waste issue cannot be solved unless the waste is developed as resources, inevitably engaging the tools of materials circular economy.

4469	Early writings in Islamic economics depicted a grand and, some would say, utopian image of the type of societal development that would result from implementing Islamic social and economic theory. However, despite the emergence of Islamic economics in a modern sense in the 1960s, we now find that the only manifestation that represents an Islamic alternative to mainstream neo-classical development is the Islamic banking and finance industry. However, the developments in the Islamic financial services industry indicate that it has converged toward conventional finance, which, arguably, contributes to the financialization of economy, as a result. Consequently, it has failed to fulfil the institutional and policy aspirations of Islamic economic system. This statement is investigated with an empirical study. We find evidence that initially Islamic banks played a positive role in reduction of income inequality, however, as Islamic finance has become a real force in the market place, financialization of the industry might have contributed to income inequality, thereby Islamic finance fails to meaningfully contribute to the realization of SDG 10, namely reducing inequalities.	10

At the same time, among the 17 goals to transform our world, one of the most important is goal 2: Eliminate hunger, ensure food security and improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. The main goal of the development of the main sector of agriculture – aquaculture is to provide the population with a variety of safe and environmentally friendly fish food products available to people with different income levels, as well as to meet the needs of neighboring industries in technical products. The fisheries sector plays an important role in the economy of any country. In Africa, aquaculture develops with varying degrees of intensity depending on the region. This review article examines the prospects for the development of sustainable aquaculture in the East African Republic of Burundi, a landlocked developing country that has its own history and traditions in aquaculture. The results of the study of soil characteristics of pond reservoirs that are of fishing significance in the country determined the further development of commercial cultivation and promising aquaculture facilities.	2

4489	As we begin to witness different innovations and challenges that the 21st century has brought into different sectors including education, some African scholars are already advocating for an education system characterised with African philosophy and African values. Such education is believed by many as the one capable of upholding the indigenous knowledge systems that the people of Africa are known for. The paper amplified the importance of community education in the current advocacy for africanisation of education for sustainable development. The alarming rate of poverty, unemployment, crime, and environmental issues being experienced in most African nations has exposed the weakness of the Western education in addressing the present challenges of the continent, thus, the need to revisit the indigenous forms of community education which were prevalent in Africa before the advent of Western education. ‘Sustainable Cities and Communities’ is the number 11 of the 17 goals recently set by the United Nations in September 2015 to address a broad range of sustainable development issues in Africa and, other continents of the World. The paper posits a proposition for the restructuring of education, both formal and non-formal, in the context of communities in Africa to make the citizens responsible and responsive to both current and future societal needs and demands.	11

4509	Built on deep-rooted political and cultural heritage, ‘rice security’ is the foundation of ‘food security’ in Bangladesh. The country has been in production-surplus of rice in the current decade feeding over 165 million people. This on-going ‘selfsufficiency momentum’ would require to maintain to meet increased demand from growing future population. On developmental side, Bangladesh is placed among the three of the world’s fastest growing economies in the years through to 2050. Rice sector would need to match with the pace of this growth. In addition, agriculture sector, that includes rice, is to double the productivity as the government commits to meet the SDG goal 2.3.1. This study addresses those issues through scoping increased rice production and productivity in Bangladesh, developing a plan of work . Results further reveal that through scale-appropriate mechanization backed up by estimated fair price, labour productivity in rice will be doubled by 2029, meeting the SDG 2.3.1. Good number of released varieties have been identified to have specific nutritional trait, and value adding quality. We have emphasized on much needed actions on demand-driven research for varietal development and field-adoptable management, mechanization for transplanting and harvesting operations, accommodation of rice in unexplored spaces, farmer-based speedy seed multiplication and dissemination system, establishment of commission for agricultural costs and prices, input buffer stock terminals for managing production risk, long-term storage and export of surplus production, and research-publicity-market development for rice-based products through public-private partnership. It is concluded that efficiency, resilience and sustainability around the three wings of DRP in the rice production systems to be ensured to achieve the rice production, productivity and labour use estimates.	2

4593	Goal 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals seeks to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services and increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. This target provides an opportunity as well as a challenge to African countries including Ghana. Indeed, the Ghana Energy Commission estimates that Ghana has about 34 potential hydro sites and enjoys about 330 days of sunshine annually. For instance, the three Northern regions, Volta and northern parts of Brong Ahafo have radiation levels with monthly average of between 4.0 and 6.5kWh/m2/day. These hydro and solar resources, coupled with abundant waste, wind potential of about 2000 MW and tidal potential can make Ghana a net exporter of power when the needed investment is provided. This paper examines the policy interventions in renewable energy in Ghana over the past 20 years. It also includes a review of the literature on the relationship between renewable energy investment and sustainable development and provides policy recommendations to fast-track renewable energy technology deployment in Ghana.	7

4644	The 2030 United Nations Agenda has framed Sustainable Development Goal 9 around eight targets outlined in Resolution A/RES/71/313 . The purpose of this chapter is that the lectors, without much previous knowledge on SDG9, understand the fundamental concepts involved in each of the eight targets. Multiple discussion points emerge when reflecting on the nature of these concepts and others emerge when reflecting on them in the industry settings. The first section of this chapter covers issues concerning resilient infrastructure. Resilient infrastructure is related to targets 9.1, 9.4, and 9.a. This concept needs to cope with extreme natural events potentially associated with global warming and climate change. The second section focusses on the importance of technological innovation in the context of targets 9.5 and 9.b. In a business domain, innovation allows to strengthen industrial competitiveness and increases corporate sustainability. The third concept covered in this chapter is the Information and Communication Technology that is a key to understand target 9.c. Last but not the least, two essential ideas are discussed: Inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and financial services, which are fundamental elements in target 9.2 and target 9.3. In a certain way, it is possible to conclude that both concepts integrate all previous conceptions.	9

This paper explores the challenges of achieving SDG4 for Hong Kong in regard to ensuring equitable and quality educational opportunities for its ethnic minority young people, with a particular focus on equality in educational outcomes. The paper argues that school failure of ethnic minority students in Hong Kong is an educational outcome issue which poses significant challenges for Hong Kong to achieve SDG4. In addition to the Chinese language factor, there are many other interrelated factors at students’ individual, family, school and community level contributing to ethnic minority students’ school failure in Hong Kong. Unless all of them are addressed, it will be hard to achieve any marked success against school failure. Above all, an education policy is needed that recognizes and responds to cultural diversity to support Hong Kong’s ethnic minority students.	4

4722	This chapter explores the role of sukuk in delivering the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal nine on industry, innovation, and infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa. It is believed that sustainable industrialization, together with innovation and infrastructure, can facilitate a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030. However, public financing of SDG goals has been inadequate and the sheer size of the impending SDG financing necessary to be deployed in sub-Saharan African countries to meet SDG funding needs necessitates exploring alternative sources of financing. The chapter summarizes the extant literature around the potential link between sukuk and SDG-9. It provides insights on how the Islamic bond instrument can facilitate a structural shift toward more innovation and technology-oriented industrial activities and resilient infrastructure by 2030 in sub-Saharan Africa. The study finds that sukuk presents a potent and underutilized option as a way forward for financing SDG-9. We recommend that governments should put forward strong policies and incentives directed both at facilitating the growth of sukuk, and addressing its challenges in their countries.	9

4725	As a Muslim-majority country, Bangladesh is yet to incorporate the Islamic tools of poverty eradication like zakah and waqf in the national poverty eradication policies and strategies though waqf resources pose huge potentialities to attain Sustainable Development Goal-1 aiming at “Ending Poverty”. Usually, waqf resources are spent privately to establish and run different religious institutions where the diversified uses of it to bring the poor people out of the bane of poorness by managing the resources gets less attention. Most of the waqf estates are unregistered, illegally occupied, underutilized or unutilized to meet the social well-being sustainably due to policy deficiency and poor administrative arrangement. This paper aims to seek the way how the waqf resource can be a powerful tool to attain the SDG-1. It provides a sevenfold strategic model to mobilize the waqf resources under the seven targets of SDG-1 and suggestions to revitalize waqf for attaining broadest social well-being in Bangladesh.	1

Controlling fishing mortality is one way of managing fisheries. Fishing mortality (F) reflects the proportion of fish of a given age that is caught by fisheries during one year. For fisheries to be sustainable, fishing mortality should not exceed the maximum sustainable yield value (FMSY), which will provide the largest catch that can be taken from a fish stock over an indefinite period without harming it. 	14

4734	With respect to Target 4.7 specifically, the formation of an ESD WG within the School, comprised of staff from different specialisations reflecting an interdisciplinary focus, has served well to drive activities in this area. Through the work of ESD WG members, the SOE developed and received approval for the offering of a Master’s of Education degree programme in Education for Sustainable Development, Global Citizenship and Peace, with the first cohort of students enrolled in the academic year 2019–20. Working Group members have also engaged in collaborative research aimed at infusing ESD in undergraduate level courses, such as Environmental Education and History of Science and Science Teaching and graduate level courses such as Changing Cultures, Changing Schools; Education and Citizenship; Environmental Education; Fundamentals of Data Analysis; Principles of Curriculum Development and Implementation; and Teacher Leadership, thus targeting both pre- and in-service teachers. Through these activities, the SOE is striving to implement Target 4.7 within its programme and course offerings. Additionally, through workshops with teachers’ colleges and with teachers in schools involved in its special programmes such as Change from Within and Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation Outreach Event. The ESD WG is also engaged in research and teaching collaborations with universities in England, Latvia and the USA in various areas, including, ESD assessment, global and local competences for ESD, teachers’ understandings of ESD and infusion of ESD.	4

4803	While contextual information suggests that over the last three decades, many countries have changed their legislations with a view to promoting gender equality, evidence from the current reporting countries under SDG indicator 5.a.2 shows that progress needs to continue if we are to advance women’s land rights in the law and in practice. Indeed, provisions in legal frameworks of 15 out of 36 countries do not provide adequate guarantee to protect women’s land rights (Figure 28 chart band 1, 2 and 3 representing no evidence of guarantees or very low or low levels). 	5

4805	SDG 8 calls for promoting ‘sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all’. Even as it highlights the importance of labour rights for all, it also makes visible some significant tensions. We note, for example, that despite many critiques of narrow economic measures of growth, the focus here remains on GDP and per capita growth. This is problematic, we argue, because the GDP productive boundary excludes much of social reproductive work. This puts SDG8 in tension with SDG 5 which calls for the recognition of the value of unpaid care and domestic work. There has been a significant increase in the rate of working women in the formal and informal sector. However, there has not been a subsequent gender shift in the doing of social reproductive work. In this paper we argue SDG 8’s focus on decent work and economic growth is inadequate; that productive employment and decent work for all men and women by 2030 needs to take into account the value and costs of social reproduction. We trace key historical debates on work to argue that both gender and labour rights have to underpin SDG 8 if its promise of inclusive, sustainable and decent work is to be realized.	8

4823	Total freshwater withdrawal (TWW) is the volume of freshwater extracted from its source (rivers, lakes, aquifers) for agriculture, industries and municipalities. It is estimated at the country level for the following three main sectors: agriculture, municipalities (including domestic water withdrawal) and industries. Freshwater withdrawal includes primary freshwater (not withdrawn before), secondary freshwater (previously withdrawn and returned to rivers and groundwater) and fossil groundwater. It does not include nonconventional water, i.e. direct use of treated wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and desalinated water. TWW is in general calculated as being the sum of total water withdrawal by sector minus direct use of wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and use of desalinated water. 	6

4825	Large numbers of people remain perilously close to falling into poverty, experiencing shocks that they are unable to cope with. For the poor, a shock of even a relatively short duration can have long term consequences. Several dimensions of poverty are closely related to environment, which is often affected by natural disasters. The poverty reduction agenda could include well-designed social protection scheme to help protecting the poor against sudden shocks and the development of capacities to better predict and prepare for such shocks. Better management of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of natural hazardous events and offering resources to help cope with them. 	1

4851	Characterized by inequalities along gender, income, caste, and ethnic differences, urban areas are especially vulnerable to climate risks. Recognizing this, cities are adapting through infrastructural, ecosystem-based, institutional, and behavioural interventions at multiple scales. However, the extent to which these interventions enable or constrain the achievement of specific Sustainable Development Goals vulnerability to climate risks with limited evidence on the gendered outcomes of adaptation interventions. We find that although some adaptations such as urban agriculture interventions unequivocally increase agency for women, early warning systems and building risk awareness through public messaging showed mixed effects, with the outcomes depending on the implementation of the intervention and socio-cultural context. Further, the analysis indicates that adaptations such as urban agriculture can positively impact agency but, may show negative interactions with other indicators such as women's paid and unpaid work. We also identify key knowledge gaps and reflect on expanding the scope of SDG 5 to take a more intersectional and relational approach to gender equality.	5

4934	It has been found that renewable energy technologies provide socio-economic and environmental benefits to people that contribute to adopting and ensuring a better adaptation to climate change based on the local context. They contribute to adaptation processes by contributing to reducing the vulnerability of people, improving adaptive capacity, and minimizing climate change risk in line with SDG 7. But these are not without challenges either. Financial, technical, institutional, policy and legal issues are major challenges to promote RETs. This study shows that theoretically altogether 4.45 million tons of CO2e of the GHG emission can be mitigated per year if all the remaining technical potential of deploying seven major RETs consisting of biogas, improved water mill, stand-alone micro-hydro plants, mini-grid micro-hydro plants, solar PV home systems, mud-ICS and metal-ICS were installed after 2012. Considering the average annual installation of these RETs, altogether 30.71 million tons of CO2e can be mitigated between the periods of 2013 to 2030 at an annual additional installation equal to average installation done in recent past three years. The initial technology investment required for implementing the above mentioned RETs ranges from NRs 97 to NRs 23,247 per ton of CO2e mitigation. This indicates that though a moderate level of the initial investment is required for promoting RETs, the GHG mitigation potential seems to be quite promising. There is no liberty of inaction, so RETs can be a good case for a triple win strategy to address mitigation – adaptation – development nexus for climate compatible development in Nepal.	7

4940	The awareness and the engagement of various stakeholders play a crucial role in the successful implementation of climate policy and Sustainable Development Goals topic modeling and term co-occurrence network analysis. In order to integrate and comparatively analyze the awareness differences among diverse groups, extracted topics were compared by classifying them into four indicators derived from the detailed targets in SDG 13.3: mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning. The results show that the Korean public exhibited a relatively high awareness of early warning compared to the other four groups, and the media dealt with climate change issues with the widest perspective. The Korean government and academia notably had a high awareness of both climate change mitigation and adaptation. In addition, corporations based in Korea were observed to have substantially focused awareness on climate change mitigation for greenhouse gas reduction. This research successfully explored the disproportion and lack of climate change awareness formed in different societies of public, social, government, industry, and academic groups. Consequently, these results could be utilized as a decision criterion for society-tailored policy formulation and promoting climate action. Our results suggest that this methodology could be utilized as a new SDG indicator and to measure the differences in awareness.	13
