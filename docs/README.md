# TRAIL Workshop 2022-SDG Coding Challenge

## Introduction

The United Nations General Assembly established the [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), also known as the Global Goals, in 2015 with the intention of using them as a "blueprint to build a better and more sustainable future for all." Global issues including poverty, inequality, climate change, and environmental degradation are addressed in these SDGs. A large number of companies provide details on how they or others help achieve these objectives through social media postings, press releases, news stories, and sustainability reports. There is, however, no systematic method for monitoring the declared actions for particular businesses and organizations, or for aggregating what SDGs they are working on.
The goal of the SDG coding challenge is to implement machine learning approaches for detecting which SDGs are mentioned in such text documents, and which organizations they apply to.
